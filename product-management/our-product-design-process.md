# Our product design process

A fairly thorough coverage of our product design process can be found in  the slides and video below. Key areas this covers are:

* The skills, activities and roles that are often very helpful in effective product development
* The process, artifacts generated in each part of the process, and some questions that help elicit important considerations for product design
* Some other handy approaches for parts of the process
* Some demonstrations of why this is helpful
