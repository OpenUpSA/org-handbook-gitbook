# Initial page

Start at [onboarding](onboarding.md).

Find how we structure projects under **Project Management**.

Find task-specific documentation under **How we work**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**How to complete anything we do should be documented.**

If you're wondering how to do something, check if there's already documentation for it. If it's out of date, please fix it.

If it's not documented yet, speak to the people who might know, see if we know a way that's worked before, otherwise try something, and document it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**When do we document something?**

We don't need to document everything at once.

As you try to do something, check the documentation, and update or fill the gaps for the next person.
{% endhint %}
