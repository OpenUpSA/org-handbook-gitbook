# Codebridge - the space

Part of the lease of the Codebridge space stipulates that it should be used for community-building.

## Use of the space by non-staff

Codebridge may be used by non-staff for events that adhere to our [public engagements Code of Conduct.](../code-of-conduct.md#public-events-and-collaboration)

### Space required and availability

Establish what parts of the office they will use, and confirm that that will not interfere with our own use of the office. Events can only be confirmed once we're sure it will not interfere with our work.

Add events to the OpenUp team calendar with details of who will be using the space, which parts, and which staff member(s) it has been arranged with.

### Access

Gate tags can be made available but must be returned for the deposit to be refunded.

### Deposit

Events that will not be supervised in their entirity by staff or someone trusted by staff will require a deposit of R2 000 to be paid to OpenUp.

After the event, after the space has been checked for any damage, the deposit will be repaid.

### Damages

Damage caused by the participants should be repaired at the host's cost. The deposit will be used to cover outstanding repair costs.
