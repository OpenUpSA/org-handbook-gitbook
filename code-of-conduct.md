# Code of Conduct

As an organisation promoting co-governance and collaboration we should set an example of how to behave when interacting with others in professional and personal activities.

As employees of OpenUp we ascribe to the organisational policies where we are developing a [code of conduct linked to the policies and Human Resources procedures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-iz7yVqzH0p4P_4x5PRygPiaW1xHhF1W3Qjo0y7jPU/edit?usp=sharing) of the organisation and our employment.

When OpenUp employees, clients, partners, and members of the public are participating in public events and collaborative projects, we also agree to adhere to this public code of conduct.

This has been adapted from the [Django project code of conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/), who adapted that of the [Speak Up! project](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109123859/http://speakup.io/coc.html).  

## Public events and collaboration

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the OpenUp. This includes our open source repositories, work with contractors, and public evens hosted by OpenUp. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [info@openup.org.za](mailto:info@openup.org.za). If the response you receive is unsatisfactory, you can escalate your issue to our [Directors](https://openup.org.za/about#team).

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Django community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Django community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting \(or threatening to post\) other people's personally identifying information \("doxing"\).
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Django is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Django comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
