# One-on-ones \(1:1s\)

We have 1:1s to

* Build stronger bonds with colleagues
* Ensure there's an opportunity for people to raise important questions and concerns with someone

1:1s aren't intended to be very structured. It's just a relaxed opportunity to catch up, get to know each other, and talk about whatever you feel like.

Try to have a 1:1 with some colleague at least once a month.

Try to have a 1:1 with your reports/manager at least once a quarter.
