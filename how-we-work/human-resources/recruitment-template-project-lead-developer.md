It ingests many file formats, indexes them for full text search, and stores them files in S3. It currently serves the full PDF which sometimes means downloading 100MB to view one page. We have a budget of three days of dev time to make it serve one page at a time. What are our options? <em>How do we avoid them just saying "sure, no problem" and learning nothing from the question?</em></p> |
