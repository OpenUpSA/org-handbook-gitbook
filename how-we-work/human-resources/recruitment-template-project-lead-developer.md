          and stores them files in S3. It currently serves the full PDF which sometimes
          means downloading 100MB to view one page. We have a budget of three days
          of dev time to make it serve one page at a time. What are our options? <em>How do we avoid them just saying &quot;sure, no problem&quot; and learning nothing from the question?</em>
