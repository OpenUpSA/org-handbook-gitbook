# Recruitment

Try and ensure the candidate is relaxed and confident. You want to see the best in the person, and it is hard to see that when they are nervous. Avoid making the interview excessively formal. Prefer the style of a friendly chat about common interests.

* Get them to talk about things they're passionate about. That helps to forget it's an interview and gives them confidence.
* Listen carefully not just for their direct answers/statements, but also what's behind what they're saying.

It is important to establish not just if someone is able to do the expected tasks, but also if they are keen to. Avoid asking for a particular attribute "Are you keen to work this way". Rather ask "What would you like to work on? What tasks do you enjoy?" and see if there is overlap.
