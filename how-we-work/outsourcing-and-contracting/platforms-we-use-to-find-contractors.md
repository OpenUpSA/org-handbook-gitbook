# Platforms We Use To Find Contractors

### Upwork

* Primary source
* works best when we're able to specify a task
* an end-goal; a specific idea of what we want to get out of it
* good for specifying features the organisation wants to implement on our open source software 
* Also a source for people to suggest possible solutions
* * Harder to hold to a contract if specifications are vague

#### Why do we prefer Upwork? 

* Generally speaking, developers in Africa are relatively expensive compared to people on Upwork. \(For more info, see [Why We Contract People](why-we-contract-people.md)\)
* Progress visibility of past work of potential contractors
* Reviews of the past work of potential contractors
* 'If you don’t know someone, it’s a lot easier to get something started on Upwork than it is on ZATech or other local temp/freelancing platforms.' - J.D. Bothma

### Fiverr

* Secondary option
* another online marketplace for freelance work
* Best for creative work

### ZATech

* a Slack workspace.
* Tech-focused
* Community of tech people based in South Africa
*  * NOTE: We might use ZATech if we specifically want to work with South Africans, which can be important for government projects. Especially for projects where we have to be “client facing”
