# Why We Contract People

* \*\*\*\*

## Why do we contract external workers?

1. **South Africaâ€™s labor laws**

* Difficult to be flexible with an SA workforce
* Difficult to internally restructure.
* Costly for a small organisations.
* SA is expensive. Outsourcing outside the country is significantly cheaper. 
* Small domestic skill pool; difficult to find specific skills in SA. Outsourcing online gives us access to a much wider variety of experience and ability.

**2. We change depending on our workload, which tends to be flexible.** 

* Inherent nature of OpenUp's Agile and Scrum methodology
* Requirements are rarely fixed.
* Needed skills commonly fluctuate from quarter to quarter
