# Why do we contract external workers?

### 1. **South Africaâ€™s labor laws**

* Difficult to be flexible with an SA workforce
* Difficult to internally restructure.
* Costly for small organisations.
* SA is expensive. Outsourcing outside the country is significantly cheaper.&#x20;
* Small domestic skill pool; difficult to find specific skills in SA. Outsourcing online gives us access to a much wider variety of experience and ability.

### **2. The inherent nature of OpenUp's Agile and Scrum methodology**

#### **Our staff is liable to change depending on our workload, which tends to be flexible.**&#x20;

* Requirements are rarely fixed.
* Needed skills commonly fluctuate from quarter to quarter
