# Why We Contract People

* \*\*\*\*

## Why do we contract external workers?

1. **South Africa’s labor laws**

* It’s difficult to be flexible with an SA workforce; difficult to internally restructure.
* **Costly for a small organisations.**

**2. We change depending on our workload, which tends to be flexible.** 

* Inherent nature of OpenUp's Agile and Scrum methodology
* Requirements are rarely fixed.
* Needed skills commonly fluctuate from quarter to quarter

**3. Doesn’t align well with the legal framework; outsourcing makes more sense**

**4. SA is very expensive for development. Outsourcing outside of the country is significantly cheaper.**

**5. Difficult to find specific skills in SA. Outsourcing online provides more variety/much more likely to find people you need**
