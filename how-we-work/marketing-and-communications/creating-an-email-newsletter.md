## Customise the newsletter content

### Introduction

1. Adjust the issue number and date accordingly
2. Change the headline for the newsletter
3. Add the short 80-120 word "update" from a member of the management staff

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you do not have an "update"** for this months newsletter, delete the block that it is in, leaving only the issue and the date.
{% endhint %}

1. **Fill in the brief description** of what this month's survey is about (if required)
2. **Replace "Survey question"** with the question you would like to ask
3. **Enter the "Source" mode** (<>) and duplicate the following code for as many answers as you would like `<p class="survey-question">*|SURVEY: Survey response 1|*</p>`
4. Change "Survey response 1" to the answer you would like to add

{% hint style="info" %}
Mailchimp automatically detects these survey answers as long as the \*|SURVEY:|\* element is present. You can review the results of the survey in the campaign information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, the template has 4 blog post blocks built in. If you would like to add more, please contact a member of the comms team. If you would like to remove any, simply delete the template blocks you don't.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

1. **Enter "Source" mode** (<>) to adjust the text for all the elements of the blog post preview card
2. Change "**Article Title**" and "**Article Summary**" to reflect the contents of the blog
3. **Update the href** ("#nourl" by default) field in the line below with the url of the article you would like to link to `<a class="article-button" href="#nourl">Read this article</a></div>`
4. Update the url field in this line `background-image: url("") !important;` with the url of the blog's feature image.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Do not try to add an image to the blog post block - always use a URL.** This will increase the size of the email and might cause the email to not be able to be received.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
