# Planning a Budget

## 1. **All Things Considered: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly \(AKA how circumstances can and should factor into the budget planning process\)**

* See [here](../../projects/project-planning/stakeholder-management.md#managing-stakeholders) for info on dealing with difficult clients and stakeholders

Any good strategy should take the surrounding environment into the equation. A popular example of this in business would be the Porter's 5 Forces model. 

Plan for what you have and what you're likely to face. Be realistic about budget constraints, resource allocation, and the realities of overspending. If possible, make a forecast worst-to-best case scenarios, alongside an estimate of what each scenario might cost and generate.  \(Note: not standard OpenUp practice, but it should probably be done anyway\). 

When planning a budget, consider the political situation. Think about:

1. The possible trajectory of South Africa \(politically, socially, environmentally\) within the lifespan of the project. 
2. How will these factors affect our mission? Our clients? The people we serve? How might they affect demand and production? 

* Politics \(f\*\*k yeah\)
* Dealing with Unexpected Plot Twists \(or, We Need to Talk About COVID-19\)
* Taking stock of our resources
* The Cost of Quality vs Quantity

### **Cost Estimation**

**On estimating**

* **staff costs:**  the blanket internal rate is a baseline.
* **external resources:** ‘I think it’s fair to say that project managers mostly work with the same contractors, so they’re quite comfortable in predicting. They know what those independent contractors charge, and how long they need to do certain things. So I think from a longstanding relationship with independent contractors, it’s quite easy \(I think\) to estimate.’ \(Janine P.\)

**Historical Costs: how the past informs the future**

* Historically-based budget forecasting is a three-part exercise in social studies, archival digging, and oracular prognostication.
