# One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish: The Types of Budgets OpenUp Uses

#### Upon googling ‘types of budgets utilized in business’, the first item that pops up lists ten. According to Janine Pretorius, OpenUp usually makes use of three. 

#### **Core Operating Budgets** 

#### _A core operating budget covers a company’s known expenses and predicted future costs for a specific period of time \(typically a quarter or a year\).  Historical costs and expenses are used as a basis to project the budget forward._ 

Most costs that fall under core operating overhead are fixed; variable costs figures are arrived at by getting the average of the past six months of expenditure.   
  
Note: Traditional core operating budgets include predictions of what a business stands to earn \(revenue, income, profit margins, income after tax. etc.\) in a series of worst-to-best case scenarios. As a non-profit organization, it’s important to segregate and denote estimated streams of income flow, from temporary, transient sources of funding.
