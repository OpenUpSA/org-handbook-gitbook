# One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish: The Types of Budgets OpenUp Uses

### Our Common Budgets

Upon googling ‘types of budgets utilized in business’, the first item that pops up lists ten. According to Janine Pretorius, OpenUp usually makes use of three. 

#### **1. Core Operating Budgets** 

A core operating budget covers a company’s known expenses and predicted future costs for a specific period of time \(typically a quarter or a year\).  Historical costs and expenses are used as a basis to project the budget forward. 

Most costs that fall under core operating overhead are fixed; variable costs figures are arrived at by getting the average of the past six months of expenditure.   
  
Note: Traditional core operating budgets include predictions of what a business stands to earn \(revenue, income, profit margins, income after tax. etc.\) in a series of worst-to-best case scenarios. As a non-profit organization, it’s important to segregate and denote estimated streams of income flow, from temporary, transient sources of funding.

**2. Revenue Project Budgets**

As a non-profit organization, it’s important to make the distinction between revenue projects, and non-revenue projects. Revenue projects are defined as ‘any project that will be invoiced.’ Ideally, the project managers need to create a budget for those projects. A template can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnkaWTnviVv-5ZrqplAD2w75Ou3xbOk0MwPb6C3UBFs/edit#gid=0).

The budget is split into different costs:

* **Staff costs**. Internal staff; salaried, OpenUp team members. Staff costs get costed in at a fixed internal day rate, per person. That’s a blanket rate of R4000 \(four thousand rand\) per day, per person.
* **External resources**. Independent contractors outside of the company, who bill for their services. 
* **Hard costs**. Where project managers can budget for what they expect to spend on software, printing, various travel costs, etc. 

This is for **revenue-generating projects**. The onus is on the project managers to put together the budget. 

**3. Overall Budget for Internal Projects**

Internal projects don’t get invoiced; they get funded. Grants are split among internal projects. 





### **Internal Projects vs. External Projects: a Note on the Divide**

* **External projects** are revenue based.
* **Internal projects** pool money from our core grant
* * Additional budget-creating activities we invest \(or might invest\) in will be packaged and shaped as an internal project. This is done to allocate the activity to the Core Operations Budget, even if the activity isn’t necessarily a project itself.
