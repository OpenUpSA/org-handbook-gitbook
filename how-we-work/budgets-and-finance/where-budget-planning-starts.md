# The Thing All Things Devour: When to Start Planning a Budget

### Hint: It Depends

1. Budget planning for **external projects** begins in the project initiation phase. This is because external projects innately require strategic forethought and budget/cost forecasting, in order for a client to sign off on a budget. A standard part of the proposal process, a budget needs to be signed off to confirm the kind of funding a project will receive, and determines what and why certain decisions will be made. 
2. **Internal Projects** either align to **core grants**, or to **project-specific grants**.

* In order to obtain **project-specific grants,** budgets are required as part of the project proposal process. In the proposal process, areas for funding alongside the resources necessary to execute the proposal are clearly defined.  Approved budgets are fixed, by nature; as line items, they have to be spent accordingly. Project-specific grants are intended for project-specific ideas. 
* Internal projects aligned to **core grants** are guided by a “vision for the organization”, then aligned to the KPIs and measurables against what needs to be reported. This is followed by an estimation of costs; namely the operational cost, and the cost of implementing that vision among the other internal projects.  



### \(Spoilers: I Lied\). 

* ~~Technically the budget thing officially starts after a proposal is approved, but budget planning almost always starts before that happens. Preferably as soon as possible.~~
