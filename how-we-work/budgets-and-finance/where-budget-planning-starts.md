# When to Start Planning a Budget

Budget planning begins in the **Project Initiation** phase. Whether a project is internal or external, budget planning should start **as soon as possible.** 

\*Note: to understand OpenUp's definition of an external project vs. an internal project, click [here](../../projects/pre-project/defining-project-parameters-and-limitations.md#internal-vs-external-projects-whats-the-difference).

###  **External projects**

* begin planning for the budget during the project initiation phase.
* budget plans are a standard component of the project proposal process presented to a client.

### **Internal projects e**ither align to project-specific grants, or core grants

* In order to obtain **project-specific grants,** budgets are required as part of the project proposal process.Project-specific grants are intended for project-specific ideas. 
* Internal projects aligned to **core grants** are guided by a “vision for the organization”, then aligned to the KPIs and measurables against what needs to be reported. This is followed by an estimation of costs; namely the operational cost, and the cost of implementing that vision among the other internal projects.
