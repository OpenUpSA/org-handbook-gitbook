# When to Start Planning a Budget

Budget planning begins in the **Project Initiation** phase. Whether a project is internal or external, budget planning should start **as soon as possible.**&#x20;

\*Note: to understand OpenUp's definition of an external project vs. an internal project, click [here](../../projects/pre-project/defining-project-parameters-and-limitations.md#internal-vs-external-projects-whats-the-difference).

### &#x20;**External projects**

* begin planning for the budget during the project initiation phase.
* budget plans are a standard component of the project proposal process presented to a client.&#x20;

### **Internal projects e**ither align to project-specific grants, or core grants

* **project-specific grants** are intended for project-specific ideas.&#x20;



* **core grants** are guided by a “vision for the organization”
*
  * aligned to the **KPIs and measurables** against what needs to be reported.&#x20;
  * followed by an estimation of costs; namely the **operational cost,** and the **cost of implementing that vision among the other internal projects.** &#x20;
