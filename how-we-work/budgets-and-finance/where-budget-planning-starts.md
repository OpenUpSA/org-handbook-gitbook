# When to Start Planning a Budget

Budget planning begins in the **Project Initiation** phase. Whether a project is internal or external, budget planning should start **as soon as possible.**

###  **External projects**

* begin planning for the budget during the project initiation phase.

### **Internal projects e**ither align to project-specific grants, or core grants

* **project-specific grants** are intended for project-specific ideas. 



* **core grants** are guided by a “vision for the organization”
* * aligned to the **KPIs and measurables** against what needs to be reported. 
  * followed by an estimation of costs; namely the **operational cost,** and the **cost of implementing that vision among the other internal projects.**
