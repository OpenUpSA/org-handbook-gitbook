# The Thing All Things Devour: When to Start Planning a Budget

### The Technical Answer: as soon as a proposal is approved

### But, really: it just sort of happens \(albeit, likely toward the end of the project initiation phase\).

 **External projects** have to begin planning for the budget during the project initiation phase. This is because budget plans are a standard part of any project proposal process presented to a client- outlined, calculated estimates of what funding a project needs and why a project needs it, along with what and why certain decisions need to be made.  

\*Note: to understand OpenUp's definition between an internal project and an external project, click [here](internal-projects-vs.-external-projects-a-note-on-the-divide.md). 



**Internal projects** either align to **core grants**, or to **project-specific grants**.

* In order to obtain **project-specific grants,** budgets are required as part of the project proposal process. In the proposal process, areas for funding alongside the resources necessary to execute the proposal are clearly defined.  Approved budgets are fixed, by nature; as line items, they have to be spent accordingly. Project-specific grants are intended for project-specific ideas. 
* Internal projects aligned to **core grants** are guided by a “vision for the organization”, then aligned to the KPIs and measurables against what needs to be reported. This is followed by an estimation of costs; namely the operational cost, and the cost of implementing that vision among the other internal projects.
