# Capturing and approving invoices for payment

This covers both automated payments and post-pay invoices.

Two people must be involved in capturing and approving an invoice so that one can check the other's work.

Project managers will not normally have Approval access in Xero. Project managers will normally only have Draft access so that they can enter their projects' invoices.

Project managers should be entering their invoices rather than Finance, because the project manager knows better how to categorise the costs to match up with how it was budgeted. They need the Chart of Accounts to be able to do this properly.
