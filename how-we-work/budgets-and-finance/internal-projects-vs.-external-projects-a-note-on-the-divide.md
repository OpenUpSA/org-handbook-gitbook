# Internal Projects vs. External Projects: A Note On The Divide

**External projects** are revenue based.

**Internal projects** pool money from our core grant

* Additional budget-creating activities we invest \(or might invest\) in will be packaged and shaped as an internal project. This is done to allocate the activity to the Core Operations Budget, even if the activity isnâ€™t necessarily a project itself.
