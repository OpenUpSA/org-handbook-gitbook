## **How to create a budget**

### **Budget Creation: Where Budget Planning Starts**

* **Budgets are primarily created around an intention we’re willing to spend money on.** 
* **OpenUp uses projects to derive value on how we allocate core budgeting**
* **Categorizing OpenUp’s projects**
* * **How our projects are broadly divided**
* * **External projects: revenue based.**
  * **Internal projects: projects that pool from our core grant.**
  * * **Then often there’ll be activities or things that we feel are worth investing in. They aren’t necessarily projects, but they will be packaged and shaped as an internal project**

   3. **Overall Budget for Internal Projects**
      1. **Internal projects don't get invoiced; they get funded. So the grants that we get in are split among internal projects.**

  * **What baseline- if any- do you use to estimate costs?**
  * **When do you start planning a budget during the project process?**

## **How to spend a budget**

1. **Core funders.  So, we’ve got two major funders at the moment. core funders. OSF and Illuminate.** 
   1. **Restricted grants: restricted to be spent on certain projects.** 
   2. **Unrestricted grants: we’ve got an overall budget that shows how we intend to spend for 12 months across various internal projects.** 
2. **Overall budgets: reviewed every quarter. Gives us an idea of how we spend the unrestricted grant.** 
3. **Other sources for revenue projects, they get invoiced, and we aim to make a profit from those, in terms of where that money will go.** 
   1. **As an org, we’d like to move to a place where profit from revenue projects can pay for core operating expenses, so core operating expenses don't get paid from grants.** 
4. **Core Questions**

* * **Where does funding come from, and how do you decide where the money goes?** 
  * **How do you prioritize where to allocate limited funds, for equally important things/tasks?**
  * 

## **How to adjust a budget**

* * **What is OpenUp’s policy on adjusting budgets?**
  * **When and how often do adjustments usually happen? What are the typical circumstances involved?**
    * **Internal Budget**
      * **Operating Costs**
      * **Expenses**
    * **External Budget**
  * **How do you prioritize where to allocate limited funds, for equally important things/tasks?**

**Where Budget Planning Starts**

\*\*\*\*

**Types of Budgets: Core Operating Budget**

There are different types of budgets. Namely core expenses budgets around February \(that’s an easy one\). We take our historical core expenses, and from a historical  basis, project our budget forward. This is mostly intended for our core operating overhead. A lot of these costs are fixed costs per month, or the variable costs we were able to take an average of \(based on\) the past six months of expenditure. So that’s our core operating budget.   


**Revenue Projects**

Revenue projects are defined as ‘any project that will be invoiced.’ Ideally, the project managers need to create a budget for those projects. \(We can put together a template- like a guideline- for how they can create their budgets.\)  


We split the budgets into different costs:  


* Staff costs. Internal staff; salaried, OpenUp team members. Staff costs get costed in at a fixed internal day rate, per person. That’s a blanket rate of R4000 \(four thousand rand\) per day, per person.
* External resources. Independent contractors outside of the company, who bill for their services. 
* Hard costs. Where project managers can budget for what they expect to spend on software, printing, various travel costs, etc. 

This is for the revenue projects. The onus is on the project managers to put together the budget. We can provide the budget for it, which we are working on.   


The last category of a budget worth mentioning is an overall budget for internal projects. Internal projects don't get invoiced; they get funded. So the grants that we get in are split among internal projects. 

**Budget Creation**

Obviously there’s the core operational stuff, that’s not necessarily a project, just operations. And then secondly, our projects are divided broadly into two categories:   


* Internal projects. Projects that pool from our core grant. 
* External projects. Revenue based. 
* 
Then often there’ll be activities or things that we feel are worth investing in. They aren’t necessarily projects, but they will be packaged and shaped as an internal project, that we will give value to how we allocate core budgeting.   


While that doesn’t answer the question, I think it speaks to how we create and treat budgets. Budgets are primarily created around an intention we’re willing to spend money on.
