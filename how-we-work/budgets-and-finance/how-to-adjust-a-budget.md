In a crisis like we are currently, where there’s a massive global crisis that’s impacting the economy, some of the services that we pay for on a monthly basis that we budgeted for, the actual expense is actually far higher than what we budgeted for, because our rand is now almost 19 rand to the dollar, or 18 rand to the dollar, when we budgeted for like 15 rand. So now we’re seeing like hundreds of rand worth of difference, which is actually going to exceed our expenditure, for example, of one of our core operational costs- which is software.
