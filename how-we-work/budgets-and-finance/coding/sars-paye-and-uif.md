# SARS: PAYE and UIF

PAYE and UIF need to be paid with  7 days of the end of a month, e.g. taxes for May must be paid before the 7th of June. Late payment incurs a hefty 10% penalty and so we typically make payment on the 25th of the month along with the salary run.

To pay PAYE and UIF, an EMP 201 form needs to be completed. The steps to complete it are as follows:

1. Log into SimplePay and download the PAYE report
2. Log into SARS efiling and complete the EMP 201
3. Create a payment in efiling
4. Log into the bank account and pay
