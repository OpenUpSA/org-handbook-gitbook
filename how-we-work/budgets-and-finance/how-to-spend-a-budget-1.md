# How to Spend a  Budget

### **Current major core funders.** 

* OSF
* Illuminate. 

Restricted grants: restricted to be spent on certain projects. 

1. Unrestricted grants: we’ve got an overall budget that shows how we intend to spend for 12 months across various internal projects. 
2. Overall budgets: reviewed every quarter. Gives us an idea of how we spend the unrestricted grant. 
3. Other sources for revenue projects, they get invoiced, and we aim to make a profit from those, in terms of where that money will go. 
   1. As an org, we’d like to move to a place where profit from revenue projects can pay for core operating expenses, so core operating expenses don't get paid from grants. 



1. **Core Questions**

* * **Where does funding come from, and how do you decide where the money goes?** 
  * **How do you prioritize where to allocate limited funds, for equally important things/tasks?**
