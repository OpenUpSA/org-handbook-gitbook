# Preferred tools

We prefer using specific tools for specific purposes over a free-for-all of tools. Exceptions can usually be made when justified.

* Less overhead of learning how to use different tools that accomplish the same task
* Less surprises when something isn't quite like another tool we've used for something similar
* Quick way to find the best tool, or a known decent tool, rather than having to figure out whether a new thing we're trying is sufficient
* We may have an non-profit organisation discount arranged with a specific supplier. Setting this up takes time and effort and doesn't usually make sense for multiple equivalent suppliers.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't try new or alternative things, but we should consider the impact on the organisation and a project when trying new things and treat it as an experiment. It carries risk, and we don't try all new things at the same time, but rather just one new thing at a time.

We don't necessarily need to actively move things to the preferred thing, but we should try to use the preferred options with new instances or when it's convenient as part of significant changes to existing instances.
