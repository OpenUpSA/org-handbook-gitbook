# Personal Information

## I would like to collect personal information.

### Should I ask for consent?

You might not need consent, and getting consent when you don't need it might increase the burden on you more than necessary.

You need consent if ....?

You do not need consent if ...?

In cases where you do not need consent, it is still a good idea to have an personal information policy, and ask users to indicate that they have read it. Unlike consent, there is no legal requirement for competency to make this choice. It just informs users for whom this information is useful, and demonstrates to regulators that we are trying to help users in this way.

## I would like to contact people. Is this allowed?

### I want to contact them to seek user feedback



### I want to inform them of a tool or service we offer

This constitutes direct marketing and is only allowed if they agreed to being contacted for this purpose when we collected their contact information.
