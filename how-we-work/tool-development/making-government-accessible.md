# Making government accessible

## People will eventually need technical terminology

* People will need to use the correct technical terms when interacting with bureaucracy that uses a technical term
  * rather than our special "non-technical" word which might be different from someone else's special non-techical term.
* Don't try and act like the "jargon" doesn't exist. Hiding it is harmful
* Find a way to make the jargon accessible
  * Provide more accessible terms that can catch someone's eye and for search engines to match non-expert searches
  * Provide the technical term early on in the user's journey along with an explanation so that they can learn the term
    * This is also important for technical users of your site, who would be looking for the technical term

### Example

![An example of trying to bridge between words people use and technical terms government uses](../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_2020-06-18\_09-50-42.png)

The technical term is "Section 32" or "Section 32 reporting"

The non-expert self-explanatory term is "In-year monitoring" or "In-year reporting"

This might not be beautiful design, but it makes a lot more sense than the important destination we want to help people discover:

## Break up walls of text

* We break content up into smaller sections
  * give them headings that represent the content of the section to catch the eye
* We break the sections up into subsections that each carry some concept, even if they end up being one sentence.
  * Give them headings that represent the content of the subsection to catch the eye

### Example

We often have researchers prepare a body of content that unpacks an issue in a google doc where it's easy to comment, suggest, review, and them mark approval of a specific version.

We then figure out how to arrange that content to be easily-consumed on the web, especially on a mobile phone using the above approach.
