# When, Where, and How to Hold a Training Session

## TRAINING

* Usually offered as a product, moreso than something that happens internally.
* Offered as an ongoing project and/or program deliverable
* Conducted for and among: 
* * OpenUp 
  * Clients
  * If someone needs to learn how to do a particular task or learn a set of skills.

Though selling/pushing training is **NOT** a key part of our philosophy, the majority of training offered externally is considered a **revenue stream.** 

**Internal training** is usually considered knowledge sharing

* Other members of the team benefit
* Often done for onboarding, team bonding

## EXTERNAL TRAINING: step-by-step

#### 1. Clients request training sessions they think they might need

* They reach out to us first

#### 2. OpenUp emails them back, as soon as possible. 

* Near-immediate response time is important; we have to act fast when someone wants something
* Depending on who it is and what they're asking, OpenUp might ask for client **data** and **objectives**. 

3. The client responds back with a date and time set for the session\(s\).
