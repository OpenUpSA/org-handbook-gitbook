## Process Behind Tech Development

### 1. The client comes in

* usually, the client wants a tool to perform a specific task. Or, they have a problem that they want us to solve. 

### **2. Technology: discussing options**

We ask questions, and determine: 

* If the solution needs to be built from scratch, or
* If a solution to the problem possibly \(probably\) exists, in the form of another application.

### 3. Option A or Option B

It's up to the client to decide whether they want a new tool or an existing one. If they've attempted to use certain tools in the past, they inform us of the successes and pitfalls brought on by that specific application.

We do our research and inform them of existing tools that could be utilized address their needs. We heavily advise that they use existing tools for the problem, since creating tools from scratch demands more funding and more resources. 

If- and only if- no tools currently exist that can fulfill our needs, discussion comes around to building the tool ourselves.
