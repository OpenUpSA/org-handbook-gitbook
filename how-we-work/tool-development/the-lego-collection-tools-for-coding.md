# The Lego Collection: Tools For Coding

## You Don't Have To Hunt The Jabberwocky

\(Paragraph erased during merger. Gist of what was said\)

* OpenUp tries to avoid creating entirely new tools 
* no need re-invent the wheel 
* A solution in the form of an existing tool \(or a tool with the potential to become a solution\) likely already exists
* OpenUp is not a software company; tech is a tool to, not the end all, be all solution to the problems we try to address

## Thought Process Behind Tech Development

### Why does this need to be a thing? 

### Do we really need X for this

### Adopt, Don't Shop

 It's up to the NGO to decide whether they want a new tool or an existing one.  If they've attempted to use certain tools in the past, they inform us of the successes and pitfalls brought on by that specific application.

We do our research and inform them of existing tools that could be utilized address their needs. 

If- and only if- no tools currently exist in this capacity, discussion comes around to building the tool ourselves.
