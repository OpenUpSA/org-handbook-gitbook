# Quality Metrics: Design



* First and foremost; Do it, get done.&#x20;
  * I’ve had to lower my expectations&#x20;
  * Used to be about how “good” I felt about a piece of work; is it up to a certain standard
  * Initially based on very unrealistic goals
    * Does everything work perfectly? Have I written perfect CSS?&#x20;
  * Now it’s more about:
    * Did it get done?&#x20;
    * Were we on budget?&#x20;
    * Does it achieve what the client wants?&#x20;
  * A lot of the time, we don’t have the time to do amazing-looking work
  * Sometimes, ‘good enough’ needs to be good enough
  * Sometimes it just needs to do something. Plenty of people don’t care how it looks
  * What’s important is that we are achieving the goal that the client or the project set out to achieve
  * In a lot of ways I’ve had to- not lower, because I think that a lot of the time my standards are higher than they need to be
    * Being okay with not having control over all the factors, or not being entirely happy with the look of it.&#x20;
    * Not getting hung up on stuff
  * The main thing- did it get out there, and are people using it?&#x20;
* One of the positive things recently: Evictions Guide
  * Built a while ago&#x20;
  * Initially didn’t have a lot of traction, since a lot of people in the townships prefer to do things in person instead of online. Have someone come to them. Like go to the courthouse to pick up a flier or a pamphlet, etc.&#x20;

K: Now there’s no choice

M: Exactly. Now that there’s no choice for people but staying home, the evictions website is getting a lot of traction.&#x20;

* It’s really gratifying, since I worked hard on the site and we spent a lot of time and effort on the Evictions project, but it wasn’t showing results
* Now it’s proved itself as a worthwhile project
* We got the google analytics showing two-minute sessions, which is pretty good for the internet

1. First metric: did it get out? Did it get done?&#x20;
   * For me that’s a big checkbox; Shaun’s helped a lot with that.&#x20;
   * Even if it’s an MVP,&#x20;
   * A lot of times, things live and die as MVPs. Big fancy projects, that we didn’t have the time or budget for
   * A project may never leave the MVP stage, and I have to be okay with that
   * What’s important is that it got done, and we achieved what the client wanted, or what we wanted..&#x20;
2. Second metric: are people using it?&#x20;
   * Google analytics and user feedback, as much as possible
   * Sometimes we’re not very good at incorporating ways for people to give us that user feedback, but it’s something we’re working on.&#x20;
3. Third metric: how proud I am of the project
   * Cherry on top, if I can get there
   * If a project can achieve its goal, get done on time, AND I’m proud of it? Goals.&#x20;
   * Wazimap is becoming that for me. I’m really enjoying the work I’m doing with Wazimap.&#x20;
   * It’s starting to check the boxes: people are gonna be using it; we’re getting user feedback; and the more I work on it, the more I’m happy about it.&#x20;
   * I put extra time into it, since it’s a big-budget project

M: So those are the three things I mainly use. \
