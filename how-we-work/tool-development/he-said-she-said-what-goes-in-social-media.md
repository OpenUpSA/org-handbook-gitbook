# He Said, She Said: What Goes In Social Media

## Giving Our Projects Visibility

Comms team: Roxanne \(externally outsourced\), Matt, Shaun, Lailah.

* Most of our social media management is outsourced to Roxanne, someone we’ve worked with before. She also writes for our blog. 

#### Blogs

A backlog of blogs is created. Not all blogs go directly onto social media. Short blogs- basically posts- do. Long blogs go to Medium or onto our website. 

Without designated media personnel on-staff, OpenUp doesn’t make a habit of generating small byte content for outlets like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. That’s mainly done in conjunction with other projects.   


Example: 

For the Creative Storytelling project, there was a budget for a social media campaign.   


We work in tandem with someone \[i.e. Roxanne\] to decide what content will be posted, and how often.   


### What goes on Social Media? 

* Updates
* Relevant news, major changes

If we want to connect with a specific audience for a project, it’s typically not done on OpenUp’s official platform. Instead, we create new platforms to engage with this specific audience.   


* Ex: Codebridge Youth. Each Codebridge Youth hub in each municipality gets their own page. Engagement is done through platforms made for this purpose. 

### Who Decides

* Deciding what’s posted online is usually a team decision. Suggestions are made based on current events, and opinions are gathered. Then material either goes into the backlog or is prioritized to come out soon.  
* We try to keep our projects visible, and put out the work we do. 
* Many organizations do good work that they fail to advertise or make public knowledge, and people don’t get to see it. ****
