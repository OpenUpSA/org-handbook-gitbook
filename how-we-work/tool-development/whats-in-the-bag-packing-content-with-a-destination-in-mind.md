# What's in the Bag: Packing Content With A Destination In Mind

### 1. Understand the problem and the user journey

### 2. Research. Accumulate information

* If you’re not a domain expert, you need to find a domain expert
* Locate people and/or reliable sources
* 
A lot of the information we need is inaccessible for many of our project recipients \(the impoverished\). It may be physically inaccessible through barriers to entry- like distance, poor Wi-Fi connectivity, etc. Maybe the information is obtainable, but dense and difficult to understand \(i.e. language barriers; written law\). A lot of OpenUp's work is about bridging that gap. 

### 3. Create a draft with all pertinent information 

* iterate the content to suit the needs of the tool

### 4. Edit and summarize, down to the essentials 

* Keep it short; keep it sweet.  
* User journey should be as quick and efficient as possible. We don't want to overwhelm and alienate the user attempting to access the content

### 5. Publish and release it 

* Collect data on the users. Identify points-of-interest from a user perspective; what are they interested in? 

### 6. Gather feedback on the content

It's important to generate a feedback loop.

* Is the content you’ve created solving the problem you want it to solve? 
* What kind of data can you collect to re-inform the content being generated for the project?
* * iterate and make changes to content based on newfound data
  * To solve the problem, better and better
