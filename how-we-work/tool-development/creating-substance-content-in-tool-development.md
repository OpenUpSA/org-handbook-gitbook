# Creating Substance: The Role of Content in Tool Development

Content gives space substance. The words printed on the pages bound by a spine between the covers of a book are what make the difference between _To Kill A Mockingbird_ and Fifty _Shades of Gray._ In OpenUp, content creation begins at the point of the project's inception. 

The content takes a user through a journey. It informs, actuates and propels the user, preferably toward a desired outcome or the output. Content creation requires understanding both the user journey and the problem a project attempts to address. Both play an integral part in determining the tone and the subject matter that needs to be created, in what form and through which mediums.

### Content Creation for Tool Development

* Synthesizing and slimming down information that already exists, to suit the needs of both the user and the tool being built
* Collaborating with coders and designers to create material and a cohesive flow
