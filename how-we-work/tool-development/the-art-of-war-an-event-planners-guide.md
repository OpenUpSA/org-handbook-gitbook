# The Art of War: the Event Planners' Edition

## **Getting the Ball Rolling: Kickstarting the Event Implementation Process**

### For Instance: a **CID.** 

**Step One**: Attempt to **piece together a contact database** of people/groups/companies potentially interested in attending. 

* Ex: Working and meeting with the National Treasury. We find out: 
  * what they want
  *  how they want it to run
* Then go through the assembled database and contact/invite the potential event-goers.
  *  via Mailchimp. 

**Step Two:** In conjunction with Step One, **start pushing things off on social media.** 

* Mostly Facebook, Twitter, etc. 
* We post a registration link, alongside all necessary registration information. 

**Step 3: Logistics**. This will always be the biggest challenge, _especially_ if itâ€™s a big event.   


* Damian Pool: transport, the food, the flights, etc.- any and all the logistics. Coordination; making sure things run smoothly during the event. 
* Adrian Kearns: event coordination, communication and networking within the event.
* Matt Stark. Content creation for events.
