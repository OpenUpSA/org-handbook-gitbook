# Event Planning

## STEPS: Starting **the Event Implementation Process**

### For Instance: a **CID.**&#x20;

**Step One**: Attempt to **piece together a contact database** of people/groups/companies potentially interested in attending.&#x20;

* Ex: Working and meeting with the National Treasury. We find out:&#x20;
  * what they want
  * &#x20;how they want it to run
* Then go through the assembled database and contact/invite the potential event-goers.
  * &#x20;via Mailchimp.&#x20;

**Step Two:** In conjunction with Step One, **start pushing things off on social media.**&#x20;

* Mostly Facebook, Twitter, etc.&#x20;
* We post a registration link, alongside all necessary registration information.&#x20;

**Step Three: Logistics**. This will always be the biggest challenge, _especially_ if itâ€™s a big event. \


* Damian Pool: transport, the food, the flights, etc.- any and all the logistics. Coordination; making sure things run smoothly during the event.&#x20;
* Adrian Kearns: event coordination, communication and networking within the event.
* Matt Stark. Content creation for events.
