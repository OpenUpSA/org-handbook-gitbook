# The Pencil Case: Tools Used In Design

## DESIGN

\(DTPs, social media, prints, brochure layouts, etc.\)

* **Adobe Suite.** Illustrator, Photoshop, LightRoom
* We're currently experimenting with **Figma**. An online design tool.
  * Useful; makes things very easy to share
  * A design mock-up can be created for a client and shared directly with them online, without having them go through the process of downloading a web file
  * They can leave comments- almost like an online, editable PDF
  * Used it for Vulekamali, Evictions, other projects

## WEB DEVELOPMENT



* **Webflow-** the backbone for most of our recent work
  * An online web development platform
  * "like a web-based Photoshop"
  * Features: custom code, interactions, responsive layouts, etc.
  * Websites can be built and hosted from the ground up
  * "Allows us to get projects out fast"
  * Helps Matt both design and implement
