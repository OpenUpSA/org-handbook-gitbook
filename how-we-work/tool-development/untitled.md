# Stop Getting Lost In The Department Store: Where Design Begins and Ends In the Project Process

Generally, it depends.

A lot of the time, someone needs something. They have the idea that ‘maybe Matt can do that.’ And then they’ll come talk to me, say ‘can you do this? This is what we need.’ Then I will basically be in charge of overseeing everything about that thing.

M: Until it’s- yeah, um. It’s changing a little bit now, since Shaun’s arrived. He sort of acts as a bit of a traffic controller. Basically if someone wants something, I’ll divert them to him. He’ll see what they need, what kind of time expectations they have, as far as how long- like, when it needs to be done, and how long they think it’s gonna take. Then based on that, he’ll assign a priority. And then we’ll include that into my sprint.

From the tool development side- it’s pretty much from the very beginning. Or at least for the most part it’s from the very beginning. There’s a lot of stuff, work that JD does. He- a lot of his projects, like Vulekamali, started before I was here.   


So on certain projects, I will get involved from the very beginning, because I’ve done development work on that project before. So for instance, there are elements of Vulekamali that I’ve worked on before. For instance, we built the procurement page, the performance page, and Vulekamali Create \(? 7:32\). All things that we’ve worked on since I arrived.   


So whenever anything is required on that, I’m involved the whole way through. But sometimes, it \[might\] just be for some advice on something. Or I’ll need to do a Y-frame to show to the clients, to get approval.   


Umm...I dunno. It basically starts at the earliest possible phase. Whenever that is. Sometimes a project will be halfway through. Or something will already be in the pipeline, and then they’ll need me to come, and jump in.   


It’s hard to really say where I jump in. Basically whenever I’m needed. But I will say, ideally; as early as possible. It’s just best, y’know, If I’m part of those original briefing conversations; like for instance, the NEMISA project. If I’m involved and get to chat with the client upfront. Ask them ‘what do you need to achieve?’ ‘Okay; like, let's brainstorm some ideas on how to achieve that.’ Maybe putting together Y-frames there, or work on the cost estimates with Shaun.   


That’s an ideal situation. And that works better for me, as opposed to getting brought in halfway through the process.  Because I think that with the design process- it’s important to clarify what it is you wanna achieve, y’know? When you run something through the design process, it forces you to prioritise. It forces you to make sure that your content is correct, and that the reason that you’re doing something is locked down and valid.  


 I think, on most projects, as early as possible. But generally it’s hard to say when it starts, besides early. And it ends- um. Once- I’ve delivered...something, whatever it was, y’know? Whether it’s a Y-frame, or a finished website, or a deployed website, or a mockup.
