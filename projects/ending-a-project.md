# Project Close-out

## Close-out Report \(what did we learn?\)

#### Documents and checklists utilized during the Project Close-out stage

**Adrian K:** Within each milestone, I tick off objectives or activities, which are all linked to a particular contract. So I’ll take the contract and the terms of agreement and say, okay: in terms of POR 1, I’ve delivered xyz; here are the URL links, here are the screenshots. These all go into a close-out stage report.  


Trello Board would have checklists, broken down into tasks and activities. The overall checklist would be the contract itself, signed by OpenUp and the client.  

We use Google Suite to do our work. I think it’s convenient and quite important for us to record information directly onto Google Drive, so we can easily continue what’s been done.   


## Retrospective

The retrospective is a Scrum\* tool. As per a Scrum retrospective, OpenUp goes through a list of standardized questions \(i.e. what went well, what could’ve gone better, celebrating wins, implementing new lessons or discoveries for the next cycle, etc\). OpenUp uses it to identify action points\*\*, and where there were issues or problems.   


Scrum works in timebox sprints. OpenUp has a policy of doing this at the end of every project.

However, the standard approach toward identifying action points is to do so at the end of each sprint, which allows for time to update things and fix issues while the project is still ongoing.   


\* Scrum: an Agile Project Management methodology

\*\*Action points: things/learnings the organization wants to bring forward into another project or iteration.   


## Donor thanks

**Adrian K: \(ask Lailah\)**

**Jen W:** So donor thanks- if I recall correctly- was the main thing we often forgot to give to our donors at the end of a project. Donor thanks, for me, is a couple of things. One, we should have the donor mentioned on the website, ideally linked to a project page. I’m not quite sure what the state of the website is, if we’re looking at projects, but they should be there. And then sort of a social media thanks as well. And I see that as going hand in hand with a blog article? So I would kind of group those two together. So the blog article kind of thanks the donor loud and \*clearly\*, and maybe links to- if it is there- a project page on the website.

## One-pager write up

**Adrian K: \(ask Lailah\)**  


**Jen W:** How I understood this years ago was that this would be ideal for, well, the organization in general, but also very much for Adi’s pitch shtick and business development functions. That as we complete a project, we have a little write-up on it, maybe some screenshots, that go into a body of knowledge that is essentially everything that we’ve done.   


I think it might be nice to see if we could collapse the one page write-up to something on the website, so that they become one and the same thing. So that ensures that all of our projects, after projects and previous projects are always reflected on the OpenUp website as well.

## Blog article

**Jen W:** If there’s- if there’s something- for instance, if there’s something really interesting from a technical point of view that we’ve discovered or we’ve learnt during the course of a project? In the past, it’s been that- Adi might write up a technical guide on a “how to,” based on the learnings that we’ve had. Um...I think that this blog post that’s part of close-out is a wrap-up/summary of what we’ve done, who we’ve done it for, any exciting highlights/key wins; which is why I think it would be nice to wrap it in with the one-pager.   


**Is the blog article written while the project is ongoing, or after the project finishes?**

**Adrian K:** I think a blog article can be done at the end of each stage \(if the project allows for the existence of stages\).

**Jen W:** In terms of how long it takes? I think it’s really dependent on whether we’re blogging about it during the process, or after. There might be reasons why we blog about it during the process; if we want to drum up some excitement and anticipation around it, if we’ve got sort of a key audience and we want to keep them abreast of developments and how far we are. But I think at the very least we should do kind of a close-out blog. W:   


## Maintenance plan \(if necessary\)

Simply put, maintenance is all about understanding how a project will be sustained once the budget runs out. Also known as a sustainability plan or an exit plan, a maintenance plan \(or maintenance manual\) plots out this objective. The plan also outlines the documentation taken throughout the project, if certain ideas are feasible, potential opportunities, etc. 

Though it’s thought to be more relevant for Projects than for Products, product management uses them to sustain and fund projects. These plans are necessary to help the organization understand what budget is available for this purpose- along with how much can go toward supporting it.
