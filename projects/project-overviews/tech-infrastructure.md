# Tech Infrastructure

### Objectives

* Ensure OpenUp is in a position to use technology that enables a project to succeed or be more effective than it would have been otherwise
  * We have access to people with the right skills
  * We are aware of best practises for specific needs
  * We are aware of appropriate tools for specific needs
* Ensure we maintain tools that people rely on, or find them a home where they will be sustained

### Tech Infrastructure vs Devops

DevOps brings the deployment and management of systems closer to the software development.

**Spending on Tech Infrastructure should be minimised - all expenditure that can be allocated to a particular project should be done as part of that project. Tech Infrastructure should only be doing the work that enables technology work to be done effectively on specific projects.**

The role Tech Infrastructure is to do the work that can not be directly tied to a project, for example

* Replacing a DBMS that hosts databases for many projects
* Exploring a general strategy or tool for how we might do things
* Documenting standard operations

Related work that would fall under the project might be

* Creating a database
* Configuring an application on a server
* Setting up load-balancing for a particular application
