**Tech Lead:** JD Bothma\


### Description

The project entails the development of a localised business database that is pre-populated from data relating to businesses in the municipality extracted from the company register. Such a site that is developed for a local government body ie a municipality, is replicable and scalable to other local municipalities with the aim of national implementation. These local databases are accessible to the public, and have a user interface that allows the local government officials to log on and update existing information.

### Opportunities

#### Strategy

The easiest way we currently believe we can achieve the objective

* We can use CIPC data to build a business portal which is valuable both to the public and the municipal staff.
* For the muni it helps with reporting to provincial government, and with planning regarding local economic development.
* For the public it's an easy way to find local businesses and see what the market looks like if they want to start a local business.
* Businesses can submit their information to the municipality, thus starting a dialogue

#### Other opportunities

People love ice cream. We could get municipal officials to sell ice cream and start a dialogue with patrons and collect their data. _(this suggestion is facetious just to demonstrate the point that there are other opportunities and potential strategies)_

### Principles

Revenue from this should be reinvested in the the local community e.g. through participation in the portal and municipal affairs.
