# Maintenance plan \(if necessary\)

## Maintenance

* understanding how a project will be sustained once the budget runs out. 
* Also known as a sustainability plan or an exit plan
* a **maintenance plan \(**or **maintenance manual**\) plots out this objective. 
* The plan also outlines: 
* * the documentation taken throughout the project
  * if certain ideas are feasible
  * potential opportunities, etc. 
* **Have we documented everything?**
* **Do we have a sustainability plan/exit strategy that could be handed to a partner?**
* **Do I have enough documentation for the last three years to outline how certain things are done on the site?** 

### Maintenance: Product Management

Though itâ€™s thought to be more relevant for Projects than for Products, product management uses them to sustain and fund projects. These plans are necessary to help the organization understand what budget is available for this purpose- along with how much can go toward supporting it.
