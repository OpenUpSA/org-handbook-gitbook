**Adrian K:** Within each milestone, I tick off objectives or activities, which are all linked to a particular contract. So I’ll take the contract and the terms of agreement and say, okay: in terms of POR 1, I’ve delivered xyz; here are the URL links, here are the screenshots. These all go into a close-out stage report.  


Trello Board would have checklists, broken down into tasks and activities. The overall checklist would be the contract itself, signed by OpenUp and the client.  

We use Google Suite to do our work. I think it’s convenient and quite important for us to record information directly onto Google Drive, so we can easily continue what’s been done.
