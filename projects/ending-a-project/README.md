**Adrian K:** Within each milestone, I tick off objectives or activities, which are all linked to a particular contract. So I’ll take the contract and the terms of agreement and say, okay: in terms of POR 1, I’ve delivered xyz; here are the URL links, here are the screenshots. These all go into a close-out stage report.\


Trello Board would have checklists, broken down into tasks and activities. The overall checklist would be the contract itself, signed by OpenUp and the client. &#x20;

We use Google Suite to do our work. I think it’s convenient and quite important for us to record information directly onto Google Drive, so we can easily continue what’s been done. \
