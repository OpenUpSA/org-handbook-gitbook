# Donor thanks

**Adrian K: \(ask Lailah\)**

**Jen W:** So donor thanks- if I recall correctly- was the main thing we often forgot to give to our donors at the end of a project. Donor thanks, for me, is a couple of things. One, we should have the donor mentioned on the website, ideally linked to a project page. I’m not quite sure what the state of the website is, if we’re looking at projects, but they should be there. And then sort of a social media thanks as well. And I see that as going hand in hand with a blog article? So I would kind of group those two together. So the blog article kind of thanks the donor loud and \*clearly\*, and maybe links to- if it is there- a project page on the website.
