# Retrospective

The retrospective is a Scrum\* tool. As per a Scrum retrospective, OpenUp goes through a list of standardized questions \(i.e. what went well, what couldâ€™ve gone better, celebrating wins, implementing new lessons or discoveries for the next cycle, etc\). OpenUp uses it to identify action points\*\*, and where there were issues or problems.   


Scrum works in timebox sprints. OpenUp has a policy of doing this at the end of every project.

However, the standard approach toward identifying action points is to do so at the end of each sprint, which allows for time to update things and fix issues while the project is still ongoing.   


\* Scrum: an Agile Project Management methodology

\*\*Action points: things/learnings the organization wants to bring forward into another project or iteration.
