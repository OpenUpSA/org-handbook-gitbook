# Retrospective

The retrospective is a [Scrum](../project-planning/agile-and-scrum.md#scrum)\* tool. 

As per a Scrum retrospective, OpenUp goes through a list of standardized questions \(i.e. what went well, what couldâ€™ve gone better, celebrating wins, implementing new lessons or discoveries for the next cycle, etc\). OpenUp uses it to identify action points\*\*, and where there were issues or problems.
