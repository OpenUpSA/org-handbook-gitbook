# One page write-up

Once the project is complete, a **one page write-up** is drawn up and reviews by the team.

* A to-the-point body of knowledge; a compound of everything done for and within the project.&#x20;

Jen W: 'I think it might be nice to see if we could collapse the one page write-up to something on the website, so that they become one and the same thing. So that ensures that all of our projects, after projects and previous projects are always reflected on the OpenUp website as well.'
