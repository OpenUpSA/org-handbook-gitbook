# One page write-up

**Adrian K: \(ask Lailah\)**  


**Jen W:** How I understood this years ago was that this would be ideal for, well, the organization in general, but also very much for Adi’s pitch shtick and business development functions. That as we complete a project, we have a little write-up on it, maybe some screenshots, that go into a body of knowledge that is essentially everything that we’ve done.   


I think it might be nice to see if we could collapse the one page write-up to something on the website, so that they become one and the same thing. So that ensures that all of our projects, after projects and previous projects are always reflected on the OpenUp website as well.
