# Blog article

**Jen W:** If there’s- if there’s something- for instance, if there’s something really interesting from a technical point of view that we’ve discovered or we’ve learnt during the course of a project? In the past, it’s been that- Adi might write up a technical guide on a “how to,” based on the learnings that we’ve had. Um...I think that this blog post that’s part of close-out is a wrap-up/summary of what we’ve done, who we’ve done it for, any exciting highlights/key wins; which is why I think it would be nice to wrap it in with the one-pager.   


**Is the blog article written while the project is ongoing, or after the project finishes?**

**Adrian K:** I think a blog article can be done at the end of each stage \(if the project allows for the existence of stages\).

**Jen W:** In terms of how long it takes? I think it’s really dependent on whether we’re blogging about it during the process, or after. There might be reasons why we blog about it during the process; if we want to drum up some excitement and anticipation around it, if we’ve got sort of a key audience and we want to keep them abreast of developments and how far we are. But I think at the very least we should do kind of a close-out blog. W:
