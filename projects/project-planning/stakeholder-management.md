#### Managing stakeholders

The key to stakeholder management is communication. A project manager is tasked with keeping stakeholders involved, and integrating their ideas in the proceedings. This begins and ends with ‘keeping them in the loop’, by managing and understanding their needs and expectations, while meeting requirements when possible. When we can’t implement a preconceived vision for a project. This means negotiating and working toward a satisfactory compromise.   


‘_When we were speaking about \(Project\) Initiation, I think that’s the period; the most fundamental part when it comes to stakeholders. The initiation process of the project.  
If you have the backing- that is, if you have your stakeholders buy in, and the communication platforms well defined in the initiation process of the project- it becomes quite easy to manage stakeholders. This is because they know through and what platforms they can communicate through; what they can look forward to. They also know what the roles and responsibilities are in the bigger project_’. **Adrian K**.    
  
'Communication' means providing stakeholders with regular updates and progress reports. OpenUp utilizes a variety of platforms to achieve this \(see **Communication**, **Stakeholder Management**\). 

Example: helping stakeholders understand the purpose of sprint meetings every two weeks. This prevents disruption, and keeps both parties from having to make constant changes or interruptions in the process of something that could potentially be fairly complex. These issues are sidestepped by including stakeholders in sprint meetings from the get-go. 

Though it depends on the situation, stakeholder management isn’t just about managing stakeholder expectations, but \(to a variable degree\) client expectations as well. It’s very important to find the middle ground between both sides, where we can deliver on something and address the needs of both constituencies.  


#### Recommendations on Dealing with Difficult Stakeholders

Difficult stakeholders are theorized to most likely arise whenever a project doesn’t have a reporting system in place; when a project lacks transparency and accountability. 

When it comes to difficult stakeholders, it is important to set clear boundaries- a clear scope on what you will and won’t do, in regards to the project and for the stakeholder in question- from the beginning. Many stakeholders have ideas or concepts that aren’t possible or practical, within the given parameters. Maybe they don’t realize the quantity of resources those ideas would need to be implemented; maybe they underestimate the time and the effort it would take to make their initial concept a reality. 

Setting expectations early- from the initiation phase, when possible- keeping them invested and on track with their duties, and working toward a set plan is usually enough to circumvent this problem. Stakeholders greatly benefit from a place to voice their opinions. 

If they refuse to listen or negotiate, remain adamantly insistent on seeing their vision through- if they’re just too difficult- escalate and get help \(from Adi and Lailah\), depending on if the issue is technological or operational. If that doesn’t help, it might be necessary to let the stakeholder go.

## **Meetings**

1. Don't call a meeting if the same result could be achieved with an email \(or another less-intensive action\)
2. Add meetings to your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) and invite all participants
3. Every meeting should have an agenda - try to circulate at least a day in advance
4. Make the meeting default length 30 minutes, and increase or decrease as needed
5. Stick to your time limits!
6. Keep **minutes** of your meeting
7. Every meeting should produce a **list of next actions** and the people responsible for that work
8. You may want to decide when the next meeting will be
9. Circulate minutes and action list to all participants afterwards
10. Keep a record of the minutes and action lists in the appropriate project folder

**Team Management During Projects That Call For External Collaboration**

 **Shaun R:** What will generally happen will be that the project manager from our side, and whoever the project lead, or project owner from the other organization or company’s side. And generally, that person will manage their employees, and the project manager will look after OpenUp staff.

Sometimes we might work across, and we work directly with them, but what I do is generally work through whomever the lead is on that side, to speak to them to get them to stuff, and then we might work individually one-on-one with someone from a different company, or a different organization. 

But I think the best way to do it is to itemize tasks, so this needs to be done by when and by whom. That’s one of the practices that I always do. You’ve probably seen that in the Sprint plans that I’ve put together.   


* What are the tasks that need to be done?
* Who is going to do it?
* Who is responsible for it?
* When does it need to be done by? 

I think that’s just a good way of basically making it clear to everyone what needs to happen, so that you don’t have to micromanage, especially when its across organizations or across companies. 

One more thing is making yourself available to people at the other organization or company, if they need help from you.   


**Adrian K:** I have a contract with every person outside of OpenUp- besides Damian, who works with me, Roxanne, and the rest of the team. Right now, most of my colleagues in OpenUp at the moment are predominantly on my team. This means I project manage basically everyone at some point in a project. Besides Shaun and Jen really, because they’re project managers themselves. 

So with that it’s quite easy, using that internal system for me to engage them, to move the project forward, to follow in-person catch-ups, etcetera. For external people \(i.e. Roxanne\), I develop a form of contract that says, “this is what I need you to deliver within these three months.” We then agree on a budget and a reporting process. So in Roxanne’s case, she comes in on a Monday and she reports in our standups.

With other companies, it’s been rather difficult. I’ve had some challenges with one particular company that used to develop our videos. My predecessor recruited them before I became project manager. The company was challenging and difficult to manage; since then, we’ve replaced them.

What I did was run through the lifespan of that particular project with the prior company. I made look for some other service provider that was more suited to- that I can work with. I found someone else at a fraction of the cost. 

So it’s not a difficult thing. I think other companies- and us at OpenUp- need to know what we need to deliver on, through clear communication. And \(I keep repeating this throughout this interview\) communication is important on any level. Be it by email, through meetings, Trello Board, whatever; you need to to be clear, across the whole spectrum. 

So it’s not a difficult thing- I think both companies, or both organizations and us, at OpenUp, know what we need to deliver on, and clear communication. And I keep repeating this throughout this interview; communication is quite important at what level- whether it be by emails, meetings, Trello Board, whatever- you need to be clear, in the whole spectrum. 

What method do we use for what particular person, or organization within the project, that’s all.

**Jen W:** is this where a team is defined as members from other organizations that are part of the implementation team? 

K:...pretty much, yeah. Like in this question, how I’d define a team would be whoever’s working on the project/s at the time, whether they be from OpenUp or not. 

J: And your distinction between team members and stakeholders?

K:...um. Not much of a distinction, from my perspective. Even though I know there really should be. But, um, this question is mostly about how you stay connected with other teams, how, uh- really, how you work with them when your companies might be doing different things. That sort of thing. 

J: So, external resources, I would put into stakeholders, and my answer for that would apply. Internal team members- and that’s a distinction I would make in this case- would be people actually implementing the project. Implementation for me is very much technical. I know it’s very different in Shaun’s world; it’s not all software development, but my projects are mostly software development. 

So it’s about managing an internal team, and that’s where Trello becomes my source of truth. I would be able to say that I used to hold standups. I don’t do standups anymore. What I do do...alright, so maybe just to contextualize; currently my Wazimap team consists of two offshore developers, working in different timezones. Adi, myself, and Matt; so, we all use Trello and a Slack channel to do all or our communication, clarification, as well as prioritization. 

...I’m sorry, that doesn’t speak of companies and organizations, but I can’t think of an example where I’m doing that. I mean, that isn’t just general stakeholder management for the rest of the external team. 

J: So just a note for me: it’s mostly software. I know that’s different for Shaun’s projects.   


**Ways and Places to Conduct Meetings**

**Shaun R:** 

Ok, so there’s obviously the different types of meetings, um and I’d like to see what you get from all the other project managers here, like the different types of meetings that are possible. So you’ve got like:  


* Big planning meetings \(like your kickoff meeting, and when you’re scoping out the project\). You don’t have to be too prescriptive; it’s more of like getting info out of people's heads, so brainstorming, understanding the conceptualization of the project, what actually are you trying to achieve, etc. That’s a nice meeting to have. 
* Task orientated meetings- those are like Sprint planning meetings, Sprint review and the Sprint plan, a little bit like we did this morning, where we like- Okay. “What was our old task list, what’s been done, what hasn’t been done, why hasn't it been done, what are the reasons for it not being done, do certain individuals need more advice, do they need more resources, like what do they need to do their job better, and then to set the next task list. You don't want to meet too often, you want to give people time to do the work that you’ve set. You want to build a habit of not having a million meetings to re-clarify what you spoke about.
* this is the problem we’re having, you’re employed because you're able to go out and bring back what you’ve got so that we can review it again.
* Catchup meeting. These are the smallest meetings. \(Shaun’s favorite\) Probably my favorite meeting to have with people I work well with, and my least favorite with people who I don’t work well with. 
* So for example, I’ll go to Matt, and it’ll just be a simple, one-on-one, “just update me one what you’ve been doing.” And they can present their work in a very uncritical way, more like an expose, we can have an informal discussion, and I can understand how far along the project is, and what that person needs without having to really work on the task list with them. \(Although I will go back and feed that into a task list\). 
* So that’s like, the least formal meeting, where I think a good working relationship can be built.
* Face-to-face meetings
* Digital meetings- phone calls, Skype meetings, etc.
* I generally prefer face-to-face, because communication is easier there. But you’ve got to do remote when you’ve gotta do remote, and I don’t think it’s that difficult to do remote meetings.
* What you do need are people to be on time \(Shaun need’s JD’s checklist for practices on meetings\). People need to commit to meetings at least 2 days in advance; you can’t just do a meeting in 5 minutes unless people are available. Don’t expect them to be available. Every meeting needs an agenda. People should arrive on time to the meeting, and most importantly people need to set times for meetings to stick to.
* While meetings are important for planning, \(this is probably my strongest philosophy for planning\)  meetings aren’t work. Don’t see a meeting as work. 
* There must always be a list of outcomes from a  meeting. Take minutes. You don’t have to be super detailed, just make sure the most important parts come through \(living minutes doc. Attach here. All minutes are recorded here
* Task list- who is doing what, and when are they doing it by. 
* Last thing: try setting the next meeting at the end of the meeting, since you don't know when you’ll have that same group of people together in a room again, and that can be quite difficult. 
* I definitely think there could be a longer google doc attached here, like “best practices for meetings"? Because there’s a lot of different ways you could do these things.

**Adrian K:** Initially- since I come from a government background, and worked there for fifteen years- I was only familiar with face-to-face, boardroom-like meetings. In OpenUp, we don’t really do face-to-face, boardroom meetings. I’ve had to re-adapt. 

So, my favorite used to be in-person, boardroom-like meetings for communication. Now, I've become more online, virtual. Zoom, Google Hangout, Skype. I’m able to say what I want much better.

Either/or, I’m not really fussy about it.   


**Jen W:** Meetings is a big word for me. So I see there are many different types of communications that need to happen. Some are shared working sessions, like running a workshop, and that’s typically to kind of center around the problem or maybe surface solutions, or potential options to solve that problem. That might be at the start of understanding who our users are, and what their needs are.

So workshop type- let’s call them workshop meetings- I would prefer to do physically. Face-to-face, in a place that allows us to use stickies, and whiteboards, and to actually use the physical space around us. 

For status updates, I would prefer to do quick, short. Either emails, or Skype chats- or whatever, online chats.

For things like retros, I don’t really...I don’t really mind; physical, virtual, it doesn’t make much of a difference. Um, for...yeah, I guess for general discussions, I’m just thinking of scenarios. Like, chatting to Adi, where we need to figure out a feature, or we’ve got a little issue with- in the logic that we need to address. We typically start asynchronously via Slack or something like that. If it’s too complex, we’ll switch to voice, which works fine for me. 

I like chat because it’s explicit- I’ve always got a history that I can go back and refer to. Voice allows for easier conversations, but obviously it’s not documented, or as searchable, as what text is. 

 ****Where work needs to happen, I’d prefer it in-person. So when it’s less of a communique, sort of broadcast? If it’s just a discussion of “hey, this is what we’re doing,” and “this is where things are,” then I would prefer that to be virtual or email.

I guess that’s why I was trying to make the distinction between workshops and status updates. Because I think people tend to call everything a meeting- that you put in a diary, as a meeting.   
  


  


## Communication

**Shaun R:** So the tools we use to communicate are face-to-face meetings, while remote meetings are done using Skype, Hangout, Google Meet. 

Slack

* What we do with our stakeholders is create a Slack channel they can be a part of. We’re really encouraging Slack as a platform to do this, instead of email. Email can be a little more cumbersome, especially when you need to do back-and-forth \(communication\). Whereas Slack can allow conversation to be recorded. Then there’s kind of a paper trail; if people are unsure of what's been delivered, you can always go back and look at what we spoke about. 

That all make sense? Cool,

#### Frequency

#### Slack

#### Email

#### Meetings/Face-to-face

#### Phone calls

#### WhatsApp

#### Social Media
