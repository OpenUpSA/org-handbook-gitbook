## Communication

**Shaun R:** So the tools we use to communicate are face-to-face meetings, while remote meetings are done using Skype, Google  Hangouts/Meet. 

### Slack

* What we do with our stakeholders is create a Slack channel they can be a part of. We’re really encouraging Slack as a platform to do this, instead of email. Email can be a little more cumbersome, especially when you need to do back-and-forth \(communication\). Whereas Slack can allow conversation to be recorded. Then there’s kind of a paper trail; if people are unsure of what's been delivered, you can always go back and look at what we spoke about. 

That all make sense? Cool.
