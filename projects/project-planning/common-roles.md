# Roles and responsibilities

## Concerns

These are the things that need to be considered and kept on top of thoughout the life of the project - not just during active develoment, but also as long as we want any tools to be available after active development.

### Compliance

* Approve procurement, payments
* Legal requirements?
* Contractual requirements?

### Project administration

* Project budget is up to date.
* Project actual transactions are within budget
* Project is fully utilising resources or freeing them - it's not underspending.
* Meeting minutes \(incl action items\) are taken, circulated

### Backlog maintenance

* Tracking requests, requirements
* Keeping things up to date
* Clearly defined

### User research

* Who are intended users? Is that realistic?
* What do users actually need?
* What would they actually use?

### Domain research

* Do we know what we're talking about?
* Do we have a partner or can we contract someone who does?
* Ensure correctness

### Communicating using the chosen medium

* Who ensures we get the best out of the medium?
* Communicating using a textbook and twitter are vastly different
* Typically responsive web, social media, videos
* Sometimes flyers, booklets, radio

### Communicate for the user

* Do the users understand technical terminology?
* Will users need to use technical terminology to complete their task?
* Do we primarily use technical terms and provide guidance, or introduce concepts using more colloquial wording and bring terminology in more slowly?

### Visual design

* Consistency for user experience
* Impacts our brand
* User and decision-maker confidence in the tool

### Technical leadership

* Specify tasks for contracted developers
* Review change proposals from contracted developers
* Overall technical design
* OpenUp technical best practises are followed or deviated from with good reason
* Deploy changes

### Uptime - keeping it available

* Detect that it's unavailable
* Respond when it's unavailable

### Bringing it all together

* Ensure all these concerns are considered in the project context
* Make overarching decisions
* Prioritise work, what happens when, given available money, people, opportunities

## Required roles

### Product Owner

Responsible for maximising the value of the work of the team. 

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. The product owner may manage it themselves, or have them team help, but the Product Owner remains accountable.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. When a committee or someone within a client or partner organisation makes prioritisation decisions but does not own all the responsibilities of maximising value, like driving user research, we assign a Proxy Product Owner.

This is the person responsible for deciding when a product is good enough to be deployed/go-live. The product owner might be the partner however we need an internal product owner to proxy these decisions internally. The product owner keeps their eye on the larger vision and acts as a proto-user ensuring the minimum required features and functionality are delivered. 

See the full definition in the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-po). Where the Scrum Guide uses "Product", we might use "Project" or "Intervention".

### Project Manager

The project manager is the task-driver on any project. They are responsible for determining work breakdown, negotiating resources, facilitating team communication, raising risks, issues and concerns and generally keeping the project on track. The project manager acts as the liaison between all team members, including external stakeholders.

### Lead Developer

\(When any technology is involved in a project\)

* Technical design - the code is maintainable
* Technical requirements and opportunities - help the rest of the project team understand what technical solutions can offer, and their rough cost - help make tradeoffs
* Uptime - notice when the site is down and coordinate response
* Technical specification - ensure technical requirements are clear for implementors
* Code integration and quality - review proposed implementations and merge and deploy when ready

### Designer

## Communications & Marketing Lead

It is important to involve the communications person as early in the project as possible.
