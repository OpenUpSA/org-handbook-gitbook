# Common Roles

## Product Owner

This is the person responsible for deciding when a product is good enough to be deployed/go-live. The product owner might be the partner however we need an internal product owner to proxy these decisions internally. The product owner keeps their eye on the larger vision and acts as a proto-user ensuring the minimum required features and functionality are delivered. The product owner makes prioritisation decisions within the budget and time constraints.

## Project Manager

The project manager is the task-driver on any project. They are responsible for determining work breakdown, negotiating resources, facilitating team communication, raising risks, issues and concerns and generally keeping the project on track. The project manager acts as the liaison between all team members, including external stakeholders.
