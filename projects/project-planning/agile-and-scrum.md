# Agile, Scrum, and the Lean Startup Method

## AGILE METHODOLOGY

* a group of software development methodologies based on 'iterative development'
* Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
* self-organising, cross-functional teams
* encourages regular inspection and continuous adaptation
* promotes fast delivery of high-quality software, made possible by an efficient use of resources and a constant feedback loop



## SCRUM

* a subset of Agile. 
* a 'lightweight process framework' for agile development
* **process framework**: a set of practices that must be consistently followed
* **lightweight**: overhead is made as minimal as possible, to maximise productivity and allow room for adaptation and new developments
* works in timebox sprints. OpenUp has a policy of doing this at the end of every project.
* * however, the standard approach toward identifying action points is to do so at the end of each sprint, which allows for time to update things and fix issues while the project is still ongoing. 



## LEAN STARTUP METHOD

* methodology that aims to shorten product development cycles 
* creating a sustainable business at minimal cost
* Developing for an existing demand. \(The opposite of the Blue Ocean strategy\).
