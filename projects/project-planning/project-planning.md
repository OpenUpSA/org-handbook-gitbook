# Project Planning

Having consulted with stakeholders it should be relatively clear **WHAT the project is trying to achieve**, and **WHY the project is being executed**. Following this, it's time to decide **HOW we'll attempt to achieve the aim of the project**- the time to formulate a plan. There are a number of different planning tools you can use, so pick those most relevant to your project.

This plan should include:

* The question\(s\) you want to answer
* Your proposed methodology 
* Important targets, metrics, and indicators and how to verify them
* Assumptions and expectations
* Any product deliverables you may have with your client or partner
* Time frames, milestones, and review points
* Lead [roles](common-roles.md): what kind of skills will you need on this project?
* A[ budget](../../how-we-work/budgets-and-finance/)
* How the data you collect contributes to OpenUp's monitoring and evaluation goals. See [Monitoring & Evaluation](../../how-we-work/monitoring-and-evaluation-within-projects.md) for more information.
