# Project Planning

Having consulted with stakeholders it should be relatively clear WHAT the project is trying to achieve, and WHY. It is now time to decide HOW you are going to attempt to achieve the aim of the project- the time to formulate a plan. There are a number of different planning tools you can use, so pick those most relevant to your project.

This plan should include:

* The question\(s\) you want to answer
* Your proposed methodology 
* Important targets, metrics, and indicators and how to verify them
* Assumptions and expectations
* Any product deliverables you may have with your client or partner
* Timeframes, milestones, and review points
* Lead [roles](common-roles.md): what kind of skills will you need on this project?
* A[ budget](../../how-we-work/budgets-and-finance/)
* How the data you collect contributes to OpenUp's monitoring and evaluation goals. See [Monitoring & Evaluation](../../how-we-work/monitoring-and-evaluation-within-projects.md) for more information.
