# Team Management

## How to manage a team well

* Good team management checklist **\[Doc\]**

**Preferred Methods of Internal and External Communication**

**Shaun R:** 

Internally

* Slack: running commentary
* semi asynchronous. You can tell someone something immediately. 
* Face-to-face. Be cognizant that they might be working
* Phone calls, WhatsApp

Externally

* **Email: in the beginning, bc people are most comfortable with that.**
* **Phone calls: if they’re a long term partner, try to bring them into Slack.**
* **For a month long project, probably just emails.** 

**Adrian K:** 

* Externally, we should be leaning, as far as possible, into in-person meetings. Or at least, through telephone
* In OpenUp, we’re quite reluctant to use telephone
* When it comes to just picking up a telephone, I think sometimes, that just helps a lot more. 

**Jen W:** 

J: Um, what are we communicating? Anything? ****

K: So you say it depends on what you’re communicating-

J: Yeah.

K: -then y’know; you’d speak to the public differently than you’d speak to your OpenUp team, or your Wazimap team. Right?

J: Yup. And also, internally, is it a company update in terms of how we’re tracking, or y’know, what the next quarter looks like? Or is it just a note, going forward, saying- I dunno, “we’re not going to be using the coffee machine downstairs?” It really depends, to me, on what needs to be communicated.

## Onboarding

* Has everyone on the project team been onboarded? 
* Do contractors need to be onboarded?
* See detailed onboarding information [here](../../onboarding.md).

## Outsourcing & Contracting

See [Outsourcing & Contracting](../../how-we-work/outsourcing-and-contracting/).

## Meetings

How to call a meeting:

1. Don't call a meeting if the same result could be achieved with an email \(or another less-intensive action\).
2. Add meetings to your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) and invite all participants
3. Every meeting should have an agenda - circulate as far at least a day in advance along with any reading necessary material
4. Make the meeting default length 30 minutes, and increase or decrease as needed
5. Stick to your time limits!
6. Keep **minutes** of your meeting
7. Every meeting should produce a **list of next actions** and the people responsible for that work
8. You may want to decide when the next meeting will be
9. Circulate minutes and action list to all participants afterwards
10. Keep a record of the minutes and action lists in the appropriate project folder

You can find a template for taking minutes and next actions **here**.

## Communication

#### Frequency

I have no idea! May need to find some good resources on this.

#### Slack

#### Email

#### Meetings/Face-to-face

Don't call meetings for meetings sake. Meetings are a planning and communication tool but they should not be mistaken for work. Below is a list of good reasons to call a meeting.

1. **If you can justify it in a sentence** "I need X from Y!"
2. **If you need consensus** \(for something serious\)
3. **If it’s a long and important project** - you will need to meet for initial planning, as well as at key stages along the way
4. **If you’re managing people** - 
5. **If you have an important client** - 
6. **To achieve clarity** - use bullet \#1, what do you need clarity on?
7. **When the problems are adding up** - 
8. **If there is an emergency** - 

#### Phone calls

#### WhatsApp & Other Message Services

#### Social Media

## Task lists & workflow

* Features and outputs \(tracking via [Trello](https://trello.com/openupza/home) - **create a template project board**\)
* Stages and deliverables
* Tracking time with [Clockify](https://clockify.me/)

## Feedback, Review, and Reporting

* Monthly report \[Doc\]
