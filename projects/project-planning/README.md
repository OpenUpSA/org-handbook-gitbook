# Project Implementation

## **Project Planning**

Having consulted with stakeholders it should be relatively clear WHAT the project is trying to achieve and WHY. It is now time to decide HOW you are going to attempt to achieve them - you need to formulate a plan. There are a number of different planning tools you can use, so pick those most relevant to your project.

This plan should include:

* The question\(s\) you want to answer
* Your proposed methodology 
* Important targets, metrics, and indicators and how to verify them
* Assumptions and expectations
* Any product deliverables you may have with your client or partner
* Timeframes, milestones, and review points
* Lead [roles](common-roles.md): what kind of skills will you need on this project?
* A[ budget](../../how-we-work/budgets-and-finance/)
* How the data you collect contributes to OpenUp's monitoring and evaluation goals. See [Monitoring & Evaluation](../../how-we-work/monitoring-and-evaluation-within-projects.md) for more information.

If this project is small and contained you may want to do a once-off experiment. Use the [Experiment Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lg0rxIoDVkskMqfdbEtj43gCw_cMYb2zrVe_ZrWhbR4/edit) for this.

If the project is large you may want to create a **Log Frame**, a detailed **Project Plan** \(or both\), and a number of smaller [experiments ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lg0rxIoDVkskMqfdbEtj43gCw_cMYb2zrVe_ZrWhbR4/edit)within the project.

## Experiments and Sub-project Plans

## Use the Lean Startup Method

Lean startup is a methodology for developing businesses and products that aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable; this is achieved by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.

Learn more about the methodology [here ](http://theleanstartup.com/principles)or read the book \(we have a copy in the office, just ask around\).
