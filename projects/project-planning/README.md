If this project is small and contained you may want to do a once-off experiment. Use the [Experiment Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lg0rxIoDVkskMqfdbEtj43gCw_cMYb2zrVe_ZrWhbR4/edit) for this.

If the project is large you may want to create a **Log Frame**, a detailed **Project Plan** \(or both\), and a number of smaller [experiments ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lg0rxIoDVkskMqfdbEtj43gCw_cMYb2zrVe_ZrWhbR4/edit)within the project.

#### The Lean Startup Method

Lean startup is a methodology for developing businesses and products that aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable; this is achieved by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.
