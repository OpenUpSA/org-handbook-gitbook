# Project Initiation

## Aligning Projects with OpenUp's Mission and Vision

### **OpenUp's Mission**

To drive systemic change and innovation in local governance, in order to empower residents and government role-players to become active and collaborative agents in positive and sustainable development.

### OpenUp's Vision

To inform and empower citizens through technology about how government systems work, while giving them the proper tools to engage with and in their government more directly.

### What Impact do we want to have?

We want to create a vibrant civic data landscape in which residents and civic groups use data tools and civic tech to engage with government, and government becomes open, accountable and responsive to their needs.

#### What are the qualities that make a project align with OpenUp's mission and vision, and what are the metrics used to measure them?

**Shaun R**: A potential project would need to answer two questions:

1. Does it create information that is accessible to and/or could be given to citizens?
2. Does the project create tools that allow people to successfully engage and interact with government systems?

If the answer to either is no, the proposed project never leaves the drawing board. 

Both of these questions stem from two keywords in our company philosophy, that ultimately make up our metrics.   


* Informed
  *  Are people informed?
* Empowerment
  * How many people can use our tools?
  * How many people can access them?

For example: making a tool that allows people to comment on what’s going to be built in their areas, by letting them get involved in the IDP \(Integrated Development Plan\) process.  


We can measure if people are able to use our tool if people know about it, but when an event happens that people need to make comments on, the ultimate measurement of empowerment’s side is how much our tool will help them. or improve their circumstances.   


Core objectives of the mission: to open up govt data

Informed: opening up a data set

Empowered: creating a tool that sits on top of the data that people can use   


**Adrian K**: From my understanding of working in OpenUp for the last two years, our core values are to Inform, Empower, and Activate. Two of the projects I work on- access to project information, and budget information- both fall under the first two \(Inform and Empower\) in different ways. Making budget data available to the public allows the public to stay informed, and empowers South African citizens with the knowledge it grants them. This helps them hold the government accountable. 

Through the projects we have, society should be able to play an active role and make a difference, in terms of what their needs are.  
I often use the three broad segments of our core values: Inform, Empower, and Activate. Based on the demands of our clients, we start finding out what this means and how the segments might apply for every particular project.   


Inform

* What is the medium we will use to inform them? Is it going to be a web based medium? An app? 
* Who is the target we are informing?
* In both kinds of projects we have a community leader, an activist, a teacher- a target audience in mind. What kind of questions would they want answered?

Empower

* How will what we plan to do empower our audience?
* How will we give them the ability to actively interact with their environment?

Activate

* They play a part in the chain
* They might want different things
* Firstly, What medium do we use? 
* Who is our target audience?



Keep in mind that we aren't a grassroots organization. As an org, we make information available. However, we need to hook up with the right partners, and partner up with the right companies.

#### As a non-profit, how does the potential for profit influence the overall viability of a proposed project?

**Adrian K**: That’s something we’ve been tackling. Because we work  with technology, we haven’t really articulated how to sell what we have to offer more effectively. With certain projects, there’s a client, and there’s a contract. We go out, and deliver on what the contract says. Through this, we generate a fixed amount of money. Luckily, both of my current projects have contracts. So I know exactly what the fixed amount will be, and what the client expects.    


Secondly, I’d need to align the project with what OpenUp is about- in terms of our methodology, ideology, and three objectives. So far, we’ve been fortunate enough to do that.   


With other projects, it’s quite different. There might not be a fixed amount provided or promised in the contract; the project might not be intended to generate income at all.   


Evictions \(the project\) is a good example. The evictions project \(that\) Shaun was on. There’s no money coming in for services going out. Or for development, or project management. It’s basically an experiment with money coming in from a donor or from core funding, but the money  wasn’t necessarily allocated for it.   


And it becomes very tricky, because that particular project will end up taking time. It starts eating into the money and might take a whole lot of it, while running the risk of not delivering much.   


--  


My honest view: OpenUp needs to be very careful with what projects we take on board. We almost need to experiment with a time frame.  


Next, we need to establish a clear cut off. At OpenUp, we usually try to make a project aim for maximum impact, instead of a relatively smaller impact that utilizes less resources. 

I think...that we’re a non-profit organization. I don’t think our intention should ever be to look at or rely on a profit margin, or implementing a project with the view of making a profit.   


I believe our goal should be to develop concepts and ideas that speak to our vision, which is to Inform, Empower, and Activate. And through that, we should then be able to gain a space within where we work, in terms of these three objectives. Not necessarily through making profit, but to actually gain leverage for our stakeholders and the key people in our space of open data, for them to come on board with us and say, “-”  


We shouldn’t be looking at what we do as a profit making activity**.**

### Documents and Checklists

#### **What, specifically, are the documents and checklists required for a project to push through?**

**Shaun R**: So the first thing on the agenda is a concept note, or a proposal. You need to define what the problem is and what you’re trying to solve- NOT the tool you’re trying to create.   


We don’t start by saying “we want to build a website”. We say that, “this is the problem we’re trying to solve”, and “this is how we’re going to go about \(experimentally\) solving it. If you decide on the tool or the tech first- like a website or an app- then you’re confined by that tool. How do you know it’s going to work? We go back to the conceptual stage and ask,  


1. What’s the problem here?
2. How do we go about solving it? 

The second part of what we need to do is partner with a domain expert who is committed to the project. We’re jacks-of-all-trades, not experts. We need to partner with someone, like government citizen groups and NGOs, who are experts on the issue and will drive the project forward. 

**Adrian K**: With my projects, there are clear contracts between us \(OpenUp\) and the client. Clear contracts with deliverables, time frames, and an overall idea of what the budget might look like. I’m made aware that my ability to deliver all of the features outline will amount to a certain outcome. That’s the first process. 

Internally, we normally develop concept notes or a project proposal. Normally, the project manager will come up with a concept note budget and a rough implementation plan. My implementation plans go into a certain time frame, so they get pulled into my Sprint plans. For example, if a particular feature needs to be delivered, we align it to a Gantt chart or a project load map. Through these, it’s possible to develop small, mini-time frame plans. Within a bigger delivery of project features and a 12-month plan, we would have two or three week plans within them.

What else?

We use Google Drive- I use Google Drive- to document everything.   
We also document things through living minutes- notes taken when we meet up and voice out thoughts and concerns. This usually happens during project steering meetings- which are INCREDIBLY important. They give use the chance to have discussions on what needs to be prioritized.  During these meetings, we can bring in users gathered through our delivery of features. This is all made possible through our Agile project management system, which allows for time changes once data is available. 

## How Projects Support Our Mission

## Engaging Stakeholders

Engaging stakeholders will usually be one of the first stages of every project. It is important to know exactly who is involved, what their level of commitment is \(financial and labour\), and have clarity on roles within the project. 

Read this entire section and then use the **stakeholder checklist** and [**Project Overview Document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDjx5-Wfqbsi8WnyaOrEQd-r98a_p27Jjp6WQ4nj_zc/edit) to make sure you have all the information you need to start a project.

\*see [Stakeholder Managemen](project-planning/stakeholder-management.md)t, Project Implementation.







### Desired goals and outcomes

What are the desired outcomes for each stakeholder? From OU's side you may want to [create a concept note](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K-mBZlabZYBi_LApktb7eYpmR1NCo7M8oroDechZfA8) to explain how the project supports[ OpenUp's mission](). 

### Resource Capacity

What capacity does each stakeholder \(including OpenUp\) have? Commitments should be made up front regarding how much time and money each stakeholder is able to provide. The project manager should keep each party accountable.

### Defining Roles

Having clearly defined roles and communicating them to everyone is vital to a successful project. Knowing what people can and cannot do, will help you plan accordingly.

Common roles include:

* [Product Owner](project-planning/common-roles.md#product-owner) \(See also: [https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/)\)
* [Project Manager](project-planning/common-roles.md#project-manager)
* [Implementers ](project-planning/common-roles.md#lead-developer)\(coders, designers, writers etc.\)
* [Communications or Marketing](project-planning/common-roles.md#communications-and-marketing-lead)

### Financial Implications and Responsibilities

Budgetary implications for each party must be expressed early in the project in order to plan efficiently. See [Budgets & Finance](../how-we-work/budgets-and-finance/) for more information.

### Time frames and time limits

Projects cannot run indefinitely. The client or partner may have some hard deadlines, but if they don't you should create your own in order to keep the project moving forward.

#### How long does the Project Initiation Phase take in relation to the rest of the project lifespan?

**Shaun R:** What we want to answer here is, “how long do we want to do this for?”

Sometimes, a project proposal or project note doesn’t go anywhere. We’ll put it together and the project might go ahead, but sometimes, there’s no money. That’s why the budget comes last, to be signed off.

The project can go ahead, but it can incubate, or be written off as a waste of time. Because of this, we want to get to the decision making stage as quickly as possible  


**Adrian K:** I think this is an opportunity to differentiate. When there’s a clear client, I think the initiation process isn't that long, because there are set deliverables.

When it’s a project where OpenUp needs to engage possible participants, possible users, possible clients, for that matter….then the initiation process has taken quite long.

So I’ll say for a client with a specific initiation process would probably take about a couple of weeks? Or a month? 

For a non-client- where we actually have to go out and engage stakeholders/clients and sort of sell who we are and what OpenUp does- that initiation process takes \(I’ve seen, EASILY\) two to three months. 

If you want to do it the correct way, then we actually speak to all stakeholders in the space. So we explain the value of open data, and sell them what OpenUp has to offer. For example, in the municipal space, where some of my colleagues are working. 

In some instances, the Project Initiation phase has been quite easy; in other instances it’s been quite difficult because of...of. I don't know, I can’t explain that part? But I think it’s quite clear that when there’s a fixed contract, initiation into that project is simpler. When there’s not a fixed contract, when there’s a proposal or, or a concept note, then- put in a particular space- it becomes more lengthy.  
  




### Is this project a revenue stream for OpenUp?

\[Lailah, what are the implications here?\]

## Concept or Proposal

* Why are you doing this project? 
* How does it align with OpenUp's mission?
* What question\(s\) are you trying to answer?
* What's your broad strategy for answering these questions?

## Project Overview Document \(P.O.D\)

This document contains all the important project information and will give anyone reading the document a good overview of the the project; who is involved, what its trying to achieve and how its trying to achieve it. It is a very important document fro senior management and for new staff being on-boarded. 

## Budget

Every project needs a budget to gauge how much resources will be needed in terms of labour, staff time, and finances. Stakeholder engagement and the concept of the project should allow you to make a budget that can can be discussed and approved or rejected. 

**The Budget Process during Project Initiation**

## MOUs, SLAs, and Contracts

The information mentioned above should be complied into a Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\) or a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) or some other relevant type of contract or agreement. It is a formalisation of roles and commitments and sets out in writing clearly what each stakeholder has agreed to.

**What kind of MOUs/contracts are worked up during the project?**

**Shaun R:** The first thing to look at is creating a Trello Board. 

Then we create a project chart and checklist. Under the Project Initiation checklist, there is stakeholder engagement, which is basically ‘partnering with the expert’. 

Then from the concept notes, we draw up a proposal. During this stage we work to determine 1\) What are we doing, 2\) What are we trying to solve, and 3\) Who are we doing for. This is a REALLY important part of the process.   


The first two things on the checklist are the two things we spoke about earlier.   


On the administrative side of things, they create:

## Project Initiation Documents

#### Documents and Checklists Required for a Project to push through:

**Jen W:** I currently find the proposal, or the initial proof of concept note that Adi or Lailah typically puts together. From that is figuring out resourcing- so finding out who within the organization is going to be working on the project. I will populate backlogs, so that’s a lot of requirement solicitation, either from the concept note or the proposal. As well as talking to client stakeholders and internal stakeholders. 

My biggest tool that I use for managing projects would be Trello. In the case of PMG \(?\) I use Pivotal, but that’s slightly different. So Trello is where we house all of our requirements and move them through the Implementation workflow. So the workflow I use in “incoming,” which is untriaged into backlogs, which is prioritized. And then it moves to “in-progress,” ready for review, or- oh no, sorry. “PR,” ready for review. At that point I test, and either put it back into the backlog if there are issues. If I accepted, I’ll move that card into “done.” That’s kind of like how things flow through Implementation. 

What should be accompanying that is some form of documentation- describing “what it is that we’re doing,” or “why it is that we’re doing it”- that is being earmarked for the POD. I’m trying to move all my documentation into Gitbooks, because it’s just a lot easier to use and to have it consolidated in the same place. 

Manuals and instructions like that for clients and for users, I create in Gitbook too, so that’ll be a public face in Gitbook that they can access for “how to use,”or how to do what they need to do on the system.

What I need to get into doing- and it’s a big kind of flag in my mind at the moment- is creating product mailing lists. So everyone who has a version of that product would be on that mailing list, that I can do major release, sort of chainsaw \(?\) updates to, because this is a constantly improving product and system. When we do big releases, it’s necessary for us to do the communication around it as well. 

Something I’m very remiss in is communication from a social media point of view, or blogging. I’m not doing any of that currently, but it should happen- both on the product, social sort of properties; Wazimap, for instance, has it’s own Twitter account. That should be used, but I should also be blogging on the OpenUp platform about new changes and about what’s happening.
