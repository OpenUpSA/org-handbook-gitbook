# Getting Partners and Stakeholders on Board

### **Engaging Stakeholders**

Engaging stakeholders will usually be one of the first stages of every project. It is important to know who is involved, what their level of commitment is \(financial and labour\), and have clarity on roles within the project. 

Read this entire section and then use the **stakeholder checklist** and [**Project Overview Document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDjx5-Wfqbsi8WnyaOrEQd-r98a_p27Jjp6WQ4nj_zc/edit) to make sure you have all the information you need to start a project.

\*see [Stakeholder Managemen](../project-planning/stakeholder-management.md)t, Project Implementation.

### Desired goals and outcomes

What are the desired outcomes for each stakeholder? From OU's side you may want to [create a concept note](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K-mBZlabZYBi_LApktb7eYpmR1NCo7M8oroDechZfA8) to explain how the project supports[ OpenUp's mission](). 

### Resource Capacity

What capacity does each stakeholder \(including OpenUp\) have? Commitments should be made up front regarding how much time and money each stakeholder is able to provide. The project manager should keep each party accountable.

### Defining Roles

Having clearly defined roles and communicating them to everyone is vital to a successful project. Knowing what people can and cannot do, will help you plan accordingly.

Common roles include:

* [Product Owner](../project-planning/common-roles.md#product-owner) \(See also: [https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/)\)
* [Project Manager](../project-planning/common-roles.md#project-manager)
* [Implementers ](../project-planning/common-roles.md#lead-developer)\(coders, designers, writers etc.\)
* [Communications or Marketing](../project-planning/common-roles.md#communications-and-marketing-lead)

### Financial Implications and Responsibilities

Budgetary implications for each party must be expressed early in the project in order to plan efficiently. See [Budgets & Finance](../../how-we-work/budgets-and-finance/) for more information.

### Time frames and time limits

Projects cannot run indefinitely. The client or partner may have some hard deadlines, but if they don't you should create your own in order to keep the project moving forward.

#### How long does the Project Initiation Phase take in relation to the rest of the project lifespan?

What needs to be considered here is 'how long do we want to do this for?'

The length of the Project Initiation phase usually depends on the circumstances the project was birthed from. A clear client with outlines intentions and set deliverables typically indicate a shorter initiation process. Fixed contracts easily expedite this phase of the project lifespan. 

Otherwise- for projects borne from proposals and concept notes, that require OpenUp to engage possible users, participants, and clients- the initiation process easily takes two to three months, minimum. 

Some projects never exit the initiation phase. A proposal or a concept note could be put together and approved, and still fail to leave the procedural planning stage. A common reason for this is a lack of funds- which is why the budget is the last item to be signed off. Sometimes the project incubates, or gets written off as a waste of time. This is why it's imperative to get to the decision-making stage as quickly as possible.

### Is this project a revenue stream for OpenUp?

\[Lailah, what are the implications here?\]

## MOUs, SLAs, and Contracts

The information mentioned above should be complied into a Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\) or a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) or some other relevant type of contract or agreement. It is a formalisation of roles and commitments and sets out in writing clearly what each stakeholder has agreed to.

**What kind of MOUs/contracts are worked up during the project?**

Many projects birth clear contracts between OpenUp and the client- with deliverables, time frames, and an overall idea of what the budget might look like. Project managers are made aware that their ability to deliver on the features outlined will ultimately amount to a certain desired outcome.
