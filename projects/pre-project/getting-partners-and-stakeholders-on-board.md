# Getting Partners and Stakeholders on Board

Read this section and then use the **stakeholder checklist** and [**Project Overview Document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDjx5-Wfqbsi8WnyaOrEQd-r98a_p27Jjp6WQ4nj_zc/edit) to make sure you have all the information you need to start a project.

\*see [Stakeholder Managemen](../project-planning/stakeholder-management.md)t, Project Implementation.

## ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS

The first stage of every project. Get to know: 

* **WHO** 
* * is involved
  * * internally
    * externally
* **HOW** 
* * invested each partner and stakeholder is in the project's success
  * they can potentially contribute
* **WHAT** 
* * respectively, is each partner and stakeholders' level of commitment to the project
  * they want to contribute
* 
### 1. What are the DESIRED GOALS & OUTCOMES for each stakeholder?

* What do they want out of the project? 

Use the goals and outcomes to create a concept note that explains how the project supports OpenUp's mission.

### 2. What are the RESOURCE CAPACITIES of each stakeholder?

Commitments should be made up front regarding how much **time** and **money** each stakeholder is able to provide. Project managers should keep each part accountable. Resources- grants, funding, manpower, etc.- should be factored into the project budget. 

For more on resource capacity, see [here.](defining-project-parameters-and-limitations.md)

### 3.DEFINE THE ROLES of all parties involved. 

Defining and delegating roles- a step preceded by **getting to know the skill sets and limitations of the people on hand**- is a vital part of the early planning process. 

Delegating and defining roles clearly defined roles and communicating them to everyone is vital to a successful project. Knowing what people can and cannot do, will help you plan accordingly.

Common roles include:

* [Product Owner](../project-planning/common-roles.md#product-owner) \(See also: [https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/product-owner/)\)
* [Project Manager](../project-planning/common-roles.md#project-manager)
* [Implementers ](../project-planning/common-roles.md#lead-developer)\(coders, designers, writers etc.\)
* [Communications or Marketing](../project-planning/common-roles.md#communications-and-marketing-lead)

## MOUs, SLAs, and Contracts

The information mentioned above should be complied into a Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\) or a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) or some other relevant type of contract or agreement. It is a formalisation of roles and commitments and sets out in writing clearly what each stakeholder has agreed to.

**What kind of MOUs/contracts are worked up during the project?**

Many projects birth clear contracts between OpenUp and the client- with deliverables, time frames, and an overall idea of what the budget might look like. Project managers are made aware that their ability to deliver on the features outlined will ultimately amount to a certain desired outcome. 

  
****On the administrative side of things, they create:
