## ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS

The first stage of every project. Get to know: 

* **WHO** 
* * is involved
  * * internally
    * externally
* **HOW** 
* * invested each partner and stakeholder is in the project's success
  * they can potentially contribute
* **WHAT** 
* * respectively, is each partner and stakeholders' level of commitment to the project
  * they want to contribute
* 
### 1. What are the DESIRED GOALS & OUTCOMES for each stakeholder?

* What do they want out of the project? 

Use the goals and outcomes to create a concept note that explains how the project supports OpenUp's mission.

### 2. What are the RESOURCE CAPACITIES of each stakeholder?

Commitments should be made up front regarding how much **time** and **money** each stakeholder is able to provide. Project managers should keep each part accountable. Resources- grants, funding, manpower, etc.- should be factored into the project budget. 

For more on resource capacity, see [here.](defining-project-parameters-and-limitations.md)

Defining and delegating roles- a step preceded by **getting to know the skill sets and limitations of the people on hand**- is a vital part of the early planning process. 

Delegating and defining roles clearly defined roles and communicating them to everyone is vital to a successful project. Knowing what people can and cannot do, will help you plan accordingly.
