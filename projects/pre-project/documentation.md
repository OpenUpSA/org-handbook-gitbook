# Documentation and Checklists

## Documents and Checklists

Every project should \(almost\) always have the following documents

Conceptualisation documents:

* Concept Note \(template\) 
* and/or Proposal \(template\)

Capacity Planning Documents:

* MOU \(template\) / SLA \(template\) / Contract \(template\)
* Draft Budget \(template\)

Project Kick-Off and Planning:

* Budget \(template\)
* Roadmap \(template\)
* LogFrame \(template\)
* Project Overview Document \(POD\) \(template\)
* Slack Channel
* Trello Board

Through the duration of this process, Google Drive is used to document everything. Itâ€™s common for the living minutes to get taken, most notably during project steering meetings. Project steering meetings give the organization opportunities to discuss what OpenUp needs to prioritize. This is all made possible through an Agile project management system, which allows time and schedules to shift once data is made available.   


The last step is to partner with a committed domain expert- a process called stakeholder management. Typical partners are government citizen groups and NGOs- specialists on the issue at stake, with the ability to drive the project forward.

**To Summarise: Internal Project Initiation Process- Steps and Documents:**

1. Create a Trello Board
2. Create a project chart and checklist. The project manager will draft an initial concept note budget and a rough implementation plan. Formulate a cohesive proposal from the concept note.  During this stage, we work to determine: 
   * What we are doing
   * What we are trying to solve
   * Who are we doing it for. Note that is a very important part of the overall process.
3. Stakeholder engagement begins.

## Project Overview Document \(P.O.D\)

* contains all the important project information 
* gives the reader an overview of the the project; who is involved, what its trying to achieve and how its trying to achieve it. 
* important for senior management and new staff members who need to be on-boarded. 
* **A Project Overview Document \(POD\)** \(template available\). Link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oa8xMs3HE1ZlcblkTaEOKA8-yf001tuu8cnzQhTgK2Q/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oa8xMs3HE1ZlcblkTaEOKA8-yf001tuu8cnzQhTgK2Q/edit)
