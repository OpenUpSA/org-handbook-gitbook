## Where do we keep the documents?

Through the duration of this process, Google Drive is used to document everything. Itâ€™s common for the living minutes to get taken, most notably during project steering meetings. Project steering meetings give the organization opportunities to discuss what OpenUp needs to prioritize. This is all made possible through an Agile project management system, which allows time and schedules to shift once data is made available. 

The last step is to partner with a committed domain expert- a process called stakeholder management. Typical partners are government citizen groups and NGOs- specialists on the issue at stake, with the ability to drive the project forward. 

## Project Overview Document \(P.O.D\)

* Contains all the important project information 
* Gives the reader an overview of the project; who is involved, what it's trying to achieve and how it's trying to achieve it. 
* Important for senior management and new staff members who need to be on-boarded. 
* **A Project Overview Document \(POD\)** \(template available\). Link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oa8xMs3HE1ZlcblkTaEOKA8-yf001tuu8cnzQhTgK2Q/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oa8xMs3HE1ZlcblkTaEOKA8-yf001tuu8cnzQhTgK2Q/edit)
