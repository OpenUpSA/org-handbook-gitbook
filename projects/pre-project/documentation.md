### Documents and Checklists

#### **What, specifically, are the documents and checklists required for a project to push through?**

The first thing a project requires to push through the conceptual stage is a concept note or a proposal, These are used to ‘define what the problem is’, and what this project is attempting to solve- NOT by the tool we want to attempt to create. Building a concept note on the basis of preconceived tools or technology- like a website, or an app- is a good way to get confined by the boundaries of the tool in mind, limiting potential solutions. 

* ~~‘We want to build a website’~~ \(wrong\)
* ‘This is the problem we are trying to solve’, and ‘this is how we can solve it’.  \(correct\)

Implementation plans go into time frames that get broken down into digestible chunks called ‘sprint plans’.  i.e. if a particular feature needs to be delivered, we align it to a Gantt chart or a project load map. These make it possible to develop small, mini-time frame plans. Within a bigger delivery of project features and a 12-month plan, two-to-three week plans are made.   


Through the duration of this process, Google Drive is used to document everything. It’s common for the living minutes to get taken, most notably during project steering meetings. Project steering meetings give the organization opportunities to discuss what OpenUp needs to prioritize. This is all made possible through an Agile project management system, which allows time and schedules to shift once data is made available.   


The last step is to partner with a committed domain expert- a process called stakeholder management. Typical partners are government citizen groups and NGOs- specialists on the issue at stake, with the ability to drive the project forward.

**To Summarise: Internal Project Initiation Process- Steps and Documents:**

1. Create a Trello Board
2. Create a project chart and checklist. The project manager will draft an initial concept note budget and a rough implementation plan. Formulate a cohesive proposal from the concept note.  During this stage, we work to determine: 
   * What we are doing
   * What we are trying to solve
   * Who are we doing it for. Note that is a very important part of the overall process.
3. Stakeholder engagement begins.

## Project Overview Document \(P.O.D\)

This document contains all the important project information and will give anyone reading the document a good overview of the the project; who is involved, what its trying to achieve and how its trying to achieve it. It is a very important document fro senior management and for new staff being on-boarded.
