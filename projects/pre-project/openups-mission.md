## Aligning Projects with OpenUp's Mission and Vision

### **OpenUp's Mission**

To drive systemic change and innovation in local governance, in order to empower residents and government role-players to become active and collaborative agents in positive and sustainable development.

### OpenUp's Vision

To inform and empower citizens through technology about how government systems work, while giving them the proper tools to engage with their government more directly.

### What impact do we want to have?

We want to create a vibrant civic data landscape in which residents and civic groups use data tools and civic tech to engage with government, and government becomes open, accountable and responsive to their needs.
