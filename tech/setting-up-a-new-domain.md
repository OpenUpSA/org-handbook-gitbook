# Setting up a new Domain

## General

It is preferable that the **tech lead** on the project sets up the domain. If this is not possible the Project Manager or Product Owner can also set up the domain.

## Registering and Buying a Domain

We prefer Domains.co.za \([http://domains.co.za/](http://domains.co.za/)\) for registering domains.
