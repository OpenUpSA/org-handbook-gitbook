# Setting up a new Domain

## General

It is preferable that the **tech lead** on the project sets up the domain. If this is not possible the Project Manager or Product Owner can also set up the domain.

Before you register a domain the purchase needs to be authorised by the Project Manager.

## Registering and Buying a Domain

* We prefer [Domains.co.za](http://domains.co.za/) for registering domains. 
* Login details can be requested from senior management if you do not have access to the password manager.
* You can register a domain without paying for it at the time, the cost will be invoiced to the OpenUp account and paid accordingly by \[person?\].
* If you need to pay for the domain immediately, please speak to Lailah. She will pay for it on the company card.
* If you need to pay for the domain immediately and Lailah is **NOT** available, get authorisation from your Project Manager, pay for it yourself, and then fill in an [expense claim form](https://bit.ly/3sRGwyY).
