# Setting up a new Domain

## General

It is preferable that the **tech lead** on the project sets up the domain. If this is not possible the Project Manager or Product Owner can also set up the domain.

Before you register a domain the purchase needs to be authorised by the Project Manager.

## Registering and Buying a Domain

We prefer [Domains.co.za](http://domains.co.za/) for registering domains.
